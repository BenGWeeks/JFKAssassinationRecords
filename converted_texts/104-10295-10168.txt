1, With regard to the contents of reference dispatch, which were
commmnicated to tne Subject, VAIVADA has no objections and is agreeable
to conversion to the career agent category as described therein. '

2. VAIVADA requests, however, that the plans already proposed for
acquisition cf U.S. citizenship by his wife be carried through. He, and
the Station, believe that this step will provide nim with greater security
in non-cfficial cover assignments, In addition, such action will minimize
the red tape he rust cut each time he has to obta‘n new visas for himself
and family,

3. The Station will sutait a new request for YAIVADA‘s training
several nonths prior to the desired new training dates,
