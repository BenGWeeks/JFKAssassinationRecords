‘to do some very important work in an applied philosophy called
Scientology (to go " clear” ag they call it), and doing that I...
must teach all summer to make money and also to do work on -
the fall issue of CATERPILLAR, Marie Benoit andIare |
seriously congidering getting married in England, and while
I could put the trip off until next spring, she wants to do the
thing this fall, and-we both want to go clear together, So,
», congidering all of this, I think you should scratch my name,
soattope I can go to Cuba later as well as hope the Cubans
" wilt see fit to invite me later (I have heard nothing from any |
