SUBJECT : AMCLEVE/15 -- IDENA IRD #72501 a
201-30098S
BACKGROUND: a

Sabject isa. 40-year-old PBRUMEN male who has been of continuing

WOFIRM iaterest since initial-contact with JMWAVE and more recently

with the Caracas Station as a penctratica of the IDEN B organization.

PUR POSE/ PROCEDURE:

Subject wae SGSWIR Led at the request of the Caracas Station because
of several issues which tended to question Subject's bona fides, possible
affiliation with PBRUMEN intelligence through relatives, unreported assocl-
ation with gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM, plus other items specified
ia questions Hoted below. The interview was conducted in the home of

~Oecar C. KALBING in-both English and Spanish. (Subject's English is quite

good, however, during actual testing Spanish waa used to avoid ambiguity or
misunderatanding of the question content.) KALBING did the translating.

RESULTS:

Subject remains sensitive to one question which is related to his past
dealings with IDEN C but in fairness to Subject this sensitivity is believed
generated by genuine uncertainity over the amount of items which he had
been instrumental in getting for IDEN C. Sensitivity initially recorded in

other areas wae resolved through post-test discussion and responses to all
Subject was most

‘Cooperative and candid throughout the entire interview.

DETAILS:

Because of the numerous Issues which were believed in need of clarifi-
cation, a three phase test was structured prior to the interview and rehearsed
with Subject completely before any tosting took place. Discussions, ag noted,
wero in both English and Spanish. Specific cuestions asked of Subject and

answors given by him are as follows:

Have you used any name besides IDEN A? Anawer: No, except
for nicknames and aliases used with WOFIRM.

Have you ever travelled to WasHington, D. C.% Answer: Yes.
_ Oace several years ago. .

Have you ever been to the Soviet Union? , Answer: No.

_ Are aby of your elatives members of the Communist Party?
After’ some discussion Subject felt it probable that they were.
Those specifically mentioned were his two brothers IDEN D
and IDEN:E and also possibly a sister named IDEN F who is
also in PBRUMEN and married to a Captain in the Militia,

. When the question was prefacod with the words: ‘Js it your

’- belief that any of your relatives are members, " Subject's
answor was always yes. He based this belief on the fact that
both brothers hold highly responsible positions in key industries
in PBRUMEN and hence must be members. He also noted that
prior-to his leaving PBRUMEN, he (Subject) and his two brothers
had many discussions about politics and their views differed
from Subject's. As for his brother IDEN E, Subject regarded

* Bim ae the "brain" in the family and originally a very religious
person who alrended Catholic services daily. He later evinced
distrust for the clergy in PBRUMEN and blamed them for the
downfall of the church. When Castro made his move, IDEN E
was in completé sympathy with him and remained with him
decpite his apparent conversica to Communism, although
IDEN E never acknowledged that he had been a Communist and
would usually retort with a comment that he (IDEN E) was a
“humanist. "*

Aro any of your relatives working for PBRUMEN Intelligence?
His answer waa that he felt that at least one of them was accord-
ing to what KALBING inferred during his discussion with Subject
the day before the SCSWIRL test. This was his brother IDEN D,

but he-also wondered about his brother IDEN E who might also be-
’ with PBRUMEN intelligence because according to what his mother

mentioned in a letter come time ago, IDEN E had been in the
USSR receiving training of-some sort. This training laocted for
a full year and cecurred in 1962 to the bost of Subject’s memory,
Subject was reascnably sure of thio date because of the "Atlesile
crisis" and President Kennedy's death which occurred lat=r.

After thie discussion the questicn read: "Io it probably that
your relatives (brothers) are working {ur PBRUMEN intelll-
gence? Anower: Yea."

Did you know your: ‘brother (IDEN D) was working with IDEN G

before we told Pyou? ‘Answer: No. But again had some
_suspieto 8. . .

Besides the. letters we asked you to send to your brothers have
‘you com inicated with anyone in PBRUMEN? Answer: Yes..

Suit two or three times a year and with an aunt
named IDEN or which was the persun to whom he actually |
addressed the letter to his brother which WOFIRM asked him
to write. This letter incidentally wag posted in 1967 (a few
months before coming to Caracas) and not 1966 as noted in
Station files. Since arrival ip Caracas, Subject has written
his motler only once and had the letter pusted from Miami to

. prevent anyone knowing hie exact whereabouts. (In addition

to these contacts, Subject has sent one telegram to his mother
soon after the IDEN I just to let her know he was alright.) it
was abcut this time that IDEK © wrote to him and criticized

his participation in IDEN 1.

Havo you seen aither of your brothere since 1961? Subject answered

no. Last saw IDEN E at the airport in the distance but there
were employees from IDEN E's place of employment present
and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Since
1961 Subject has not seen any member of his family and as time
goes on dues not miss them as much, The persons he claims to
have been closest to were his aunt and grandmother and addresseo
comments to them personally when he does write to hin mother,
When further discussing his brothers on this question, Subject:
was somewhat complimentary despite their differing political .
views and generally censidered them as hard-working energetic

types with good school records,

Do you have a secret means of contacting anyone in PBRUMEN?

Claims he knows of friends who have used telegrarms to transmit
coded messages but he has never engaged in such activity. These
mesoages were directed against the PBRUMEN. '

> Have you ever been in Communiat China? Answer: No.

Have you over worked for the intelligence service of any country

besides IDEN J and LNIIARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever received intelligenco trelning ta PBRUMEN?

Answerit ‘No.

Have you ever been.a member of any Commeaist guerrilla group?

Auswor: No. Later explained sensitivity to the question as
. .@mapating from current work with two former Communist ©
- guerrillas named IDEN K and IDEN L beth cf whom are now

with IDEN B.

Have you told anyone in PBRUMEN that you are working with

. WOFIRM? - Answer: No. This question led to a discussion

of broadcasts from PBRUMEN which identified Subject as a
member of WOFIRM. - These broadcasts occurred in Cctcber

1967 according to Subject andthe man flagering him was

IDEN M. - The latter was not officially in Subject’s WOFIRM

grcup before his capture in FBRUMEN hence Subject does not
know why it was that _he was specifically named. When it was
later suggested that this Announcement would probably have
ecme effect on big family, Subject said be just didn't know
what effect it wculd have and bas beard cf none. He agroed
that it was quite ironic that'one side of the family was working
with an intolligence service which was diametrically opposed
to the side to which another momber of the same family was
affiliated and in fact because of his present IDEN B employment
be was actually in the business of hunting them down, Subject
agreed that it was indeed ironic but felt his convictions differed
from his brothers’ and that was that.

_Have you told anyone in IDEN N that you are working for WOFTRM?

Noted that come knew of his past affiliatica hence the question
was qualified to mean hio present affiliation. Later after
reacNons were recorded, Subject noted that hie wife is fully
witting of hia WOFIRM employment as is IDEN O. He also
mestioned that a PBRUMEN type, IDEN P, whom ac knows
from childhood has been kidding him constantly in Caracaa

that he ie stitl with WOFIRM until Subject finally told him fa
an offhand way,.'Sare I'm with WOFIRM," but he does not
know what effect thio had on IDEN P or whether he haa told .
-. anyone of bis-suapiclons of Subject'’s WOFIKM involvement.
"He specifically, denied that anyone vther than these three
pereons wore knowledgeable.

Does anyone in IDEN B know you have this mecting with us today?
Acawers No,”

Have you ever been asked to porform i any task or mission agal:
_ the LNHARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever performed any task or mission on behalf of IDEN G?
Anewer: No.

Has-anyone told or inatructed you on what to report te us? Answors
No.

Have you had contact with IDEN C since 1967? Answer: No. Con-
tinued reactions to this question which necessitated a breake
down test to isolate the reacon for his sensitivity to the topic.
He repeatedly denied that he had had any contact with IDEN C
since the IDEN Q told him not to but acknowledged a physical
revulsion to the mention of the man's name, and a long dis-

oO cussian ensued regarding the extent of Subject's involvement

with sthe man. “Subject contended that the contact began quite
innocently in 1965 and was what Subject initially thought wae a
deliberate provocation to see what Subject's reaction would be.
Subject tmmediately reported the contact to JMWAVE handlers
who guided him through continued ccntacts and instructions from
IDEN Q. Subject was instructed to sell IDEN C "silencers" (guns
with ollencers attached--about atx or seven to the vest of his
recollection) in order to find out his true identity. Subject fur-
aished physical descriptions and license numbers to JMWAVE
and continued to report on contact with IDEN C. He offored
Subject $500 US which JMWAVE told Subject to keep since it was
merely a bonus given him for his work as an intermediary.
IDEN C continued to force contact with Subject and once came

to his bome in shorts and made veiled threats which were
anewered with counter threats of violence from Subject, and aa
outright threat that Subject would kill IDEN C if he threatened

him again, In 1967 while with the IDEN R, Subject gave

IDEN C some:"pencils' to keep him away which Subject did

Bot itien report to WOFIRM but later did. lie gave him about
129 altcgether. Subject had promisod IDEN C some 590 pounds
vf-C/¢ explosives, M-2's, sub-machine guns, etc. but all waa

. intended to- bait: IDEN C for arrest and none was over supplied

teohim, Later ‘Sabject neted after reacting to a break-down
question that-he’ had supplied him with pencils, silencers, and
‘also seme grenades and ‘pentelite, But these he claims should

‘be a matter of record with JMWAVE, The grenades wore
typical military type and numbered about 24 to 48 altogether.

‘Subject noted that-be acted only as intermediary

Again, however,’

‘besweon IDEN C and another individual. who is now deceased ia

PBRUMEN and did not physically haadle any muritions shipments.
As noted above, continued sensitivity to the question of the amounts
or types of equipment furnished IDEN C ie believed attributable

to ancertainty of Subject's part as to exactly what he did arrange
for shipment to IDEN C. As to the basic question about contact
with him since 1967 (or when he was told by IDEN Q to no longer
Bave contact with IDEN C), Subject insisted that he never re-
established contact of any kind but alwaye checks at IDEN 8 to
éetermine if IDEN C is around,

Do you now have in your possession any arms, munitions or articles

of demolition which-was once the property of the LNHARP? Only
those itoma which wore discuased during-a pre-test debriefing,

‘wia., items brought & Caracas by him in a sultcase and consist-

ing of the following: 3 c¢ 4 emoke grenades; 6 or 7 booby traps

cord about 100 feet; 2 or 3 MK2 grenades; about 10 pencila {some
regular open market supply iteme and some of the "company"
variety): demolition pliers; knife; compaes; metaacope (infra-
viewer worth about $50 used), These items ke said were taken
while with the IDEN R and with the knowledge of IDEN T although
IDEN T did not know exactly what he had taken. Subject wae using

“these items frequently in training courses and they were not to

the best of Subject's knowledge the property of LNHARP at that
time although it is possible that sume of these items were at une
time LNHARP and possibly WOFIRM items. But he explaindd
further that these items are plentiful in the Miami area and caa

eseily be obtained through gun dealers. During a later convéere
Yer: . at sation Subject noted that he hac heard of many places where

. , munitions could be obtained very easily eapecially in New Jersey,
. in California and in Miami, but he denied being personally
tavolved to any ouch dealings.

= Have you ever stolen: equipment of any type from WOFIRM? Answers
. Yes. About 5 gallons of gas once from a launch boat. Other than
vs this, sothing. .

Do you ktiow the identities of perecas who stole arms and equipment
from LNHARP? Anewer: No.
Break-down questions dealing with IDEN C:

Did you Lave contact with IDEN C from 1965 through 1967? Answers
Yes.

During this time did he give you $500 for equipment which he wanted?
Answer: Yos.

Did you receive more than $500 from him? Answer: No.
Is it correct that you recolved threats {from him? Anewer;: Yos.

Besides the pencils, silencers, grenades and pentolite did you glvo
him any other items?. Answer: No. (as noted continued sennl-
tivity which io uncxplained except in the examiner's conclusion)

Did IDEN Q tell you to stop contacting him in October or November
1967? Amewer: Yea.

Did you contact IDEN C after November 19677? Answer: No. (Slight
sensitivity but oxplained as relating to constant checking on his
whereabouts to avoid contact. }

Has your employer contacted him since November 19677 Answer:
No, not to his knowledge. On this question Subject noted that his
employer can easily obtain guns and supplies from European

sources cheaper than LNHARP. Also Subject noted that the
few.guns (small calivre snub nose weapons) which he has .

reportad’ 6n in Miami some months back which hie organization
teok from captured guerrillas and which were probably issued
to a group which went to PBRUMEN and were lost. Subject is
positive-they were WOFIRM issue but purportedly the serial
numbers which he submitted cculd not be checked.

One additional item which was cloared up dealt with the pentolite
which had beon reported seen in Caracas. Subject voluntarily
mentioned that he had seen such a supply under the bed of a friend.
The supply waa attached to magnets which were to be used to
attach the chargé to the underside of a ship in Caribbean waters
of IDEN V or IDEN W naticnality, The charge was to discourage
farther shipments between these latter IDENs and PBRUMEN.
Subject said he detached the magnets from the pentolite and

’ intended using it in training chacees for students with his present
‘employer. The persoa who brought it to Caracas was IDEN X.
Subject does not kaow how he got it bere, but knows that his
employer could facilitate such deliveries,

sending this letter by messenger, I can explain gore.

Tho Governzent hore assisted a group of Cubans called the
Brigade. The Depurtcent of Lefanse (arny) proviced this asaletance
without consulting the Ministry of the Interior. When the Minister of
tie Interior found cut, he demanded an oxplanatics trom the military ,
Ben and they stopped the assiatarce.

There are strcng poseidilities that a plan will be developed for
Cuba, which will involve tie Ministry of Defense and the Kinietry of
the Interior and which will be assigned to a group of serious persons.

T believe it is highly important that I go to Miazi urgently or tnat
sone of you come here. Thie is urgente

is stated in He! i intended to advise him to stay clear of
it in order ition with CIRASH~4. We will not
_ diecuss this with him nov, bovever, and risk exposing the source, CILSHR15,
‘te a *hostile". While we would-hope, if we did talk to sHCLEVE-15 about

these activities and asked him to desist, that he vould canply, we would
not-be overly surprised if he did not. we are only fooling ourselves if
we think that agents, whoa ve like to consider ve ®eontrol", are telling

* us everything they do.

_ Be At the risk of belaboring the point, it 4s precisely because he is
the -kind of parson that ha is that AMCLEVE-15 is able to becone the trusted
Remberto

eonfidant of people like CIgsSi4, CIRASH-6,
‘ORTIZ, all of whom way be considered sozevhat unsavory charac

whether or not ve like it, run an important part of the security syste in
Venezuela. and it is precisely because of AKCLEVS-15Is position

4. We wAL2 attempt to ascartain sXCLEVE-15's motives, as requested in
Reference A, but this task will be considerably hampered by our need to

: handle him as a "hostile", waich vill preclude the uce of sone of the basic

tools of investigation, such as the SGSsIRL and the levying of requirenents.

out in 1961, Subject listed his brother Raul POSADA-Carriles as. =.

an administrator of the ‘Narianao Electric Company as a relative
He did not list his brother Roberto

in some government service.
in this section, although he did list Roberto in Para 16,

Subject: Brothers and Sisters.

2; In another signed but undated Spanish Personnel
‘Information form of apparently 1965, he again listed both his
‘brothers in Section M, Subject: Brothers and sisters, and in

Section N he again listed his brother Raul, who he stated he - i

believed to be working for the Cuban government as an engineer. ot

He again failed to list his brother Roberto, a :
3. Concerning his PRQ Part I filled out in March 1965, again © :

no mention of his brother Roberto appears in Section XIV, Subjects

4. According to POSADA's own admission in an LC Flutter :

of 14 April 1965, he had been involved in planning for a

Guatemalan coup headed by Roberto ALEJOS~Arzu. This matter later
came to the attention of the FBI. There is an FBI report dated

17 May 1965 in the 201. AMCLEVE-15 also furnished information

on this Guatemalan coup for JMWAVE, who disseminated this

information in July 1965.
5. AMCLEVE-15 informed JMWAVE concerning other independent

exile operations into Cuba in July of 1965.
6. His PRQ Part II, Section XI, dated September 1965, says

that "Subject is of good character, very reldjble and security



--- Page 107 ---
conscious. Subject demonstrated good security techniques while
reporting on the activities” _0f Roberto ALEJOS concerning the ‘
attempted coup against Guatemala.

7. An FBI report of 30 September 1965 outlines the contacts
that had been made by some Anericans seeking to purchase pistols,

blasting caps, hand gernades and silencers. This is the first

" indication in the 201.that Subject was involyed with Frank’

Lang "Lefty" Rosenthal, Miami, who had the reputation of gambler —

and hoodlum associated with other hoodluris and jewel thieves in

‘the Miami area.

8. In a report filled out by Subject on 21 April 1966
to update his employee file, Subject again reported his brother
Raul POSADA. in government service but failed again to report
brother Robérto POSADA. ;

9. A JMWAVE memo WIR-1299, 21 July 1966, explains a request
from AMCLEVE-15 to resign from his job as an instructor in the
maritime training section to accept a job or the Junta being
set up. at that time to govern the activities of RECE, COMMANDOS L,
30 NOVEMBER MOVEMENT and the 2506 BRIGADE. An FBI report of
29 July 1966 and another for 1 August 1966 both commented that _
Subject had been approved by the exile groups to accept the
position of military leader of the newly formed alliance.

10. On 1 August 1966 AMCLEVE-15 was transferred from the
ds %
Training branch to the CI branch of JMWAVE. He w&& be used to

report on the activities of the central Junta.

adi. The first mention of Subject's brother Roberto in
the 201 is JMWAVE internal memo WCI-1501, dated 21 September 1966.
In this ‘memo Subject described his telephone call from his”
family in Cuba. Subject stated that his mother told him that
his brother Roberto was in England on a purchasing mission: for
the coc and that some time soon his brother Roberto would travel’.
to Spain. Subject's mother expected Roberto to be out of cuba

for two months. He stated that he last knew his brother to be

Cienfuegos, : Las Villas Province. He said that he last saw his
brother Roberto in April 1961. This is at variance with info

.in the 1961 Questionnaire which stated he came to the U.S. as :

a political exile 28 February 1961.

12. A. JMWAVE 3182 (ZN 01749), 23 September 1966, stated
that Madrid-8990 (IN 85265) reported that Roberto arrived in
Madrid from Havana 26 August 1966.

B. Only other station traces on Roberto i ay@ 177
UFGA-20828 (transmittal of Luis POSADA PRQ Part.1) which passed
information provided by Subject.

C. AMOT files show Roberto in charge of telephone

center at Buenavista, Marianao, according to a telephone -company

1. The Station desires to explain its viewpoint on AMCLEVES=15
clearly because of what cculd. conceivably be construed to be a tone
of ispatience in the first line of Reference A, First ofall, why do
we want to hire AMCLEVS-152 > Our ebjoctive is to use hin as a unilateral
nenetration of CHRASY and. CIVISTA, which controls that organization. ©
t like to nenetrate the inner circle surrounding
IPENTITY and CIRASH=4, The recent provocation (reported in reference C)
which we believe was run by IDENTITY is a clear indication of the need
for this type of penetrstion over and above the normal need fer
penetration of security services,

oe What we are net trying to do is to make a CIGOAL-1 or
ANOT=200 out of ANCLEVE-TS: that is, put him on the payroll as an
adviser to CIRASH-4, Me want to be very clear on this point, since
this may he the cause ef Headquarters’ concern. tlis role will not be
acvisory, AMCLEVF-18 is to be used to obtain counterintelligence
information to protect the Station and its operations and to get for
us that portion of the intelligence available in CIRASH which is not
made available to the Station via the liaison channel.

3. From the information available to us, AMNCLEVE-+15 seems to
present an almost colder osportunity to Caracas Station: i.e., a cleared
KOETRM agent (who although terminated still reports to WOFTRM when in
the JVRAVE area), who is well-placed "hombre de confianza" of the
chief of CIRASH and the chief of the special investipative unit within
PIVISTA which may have penitoring of KOFIRM activities as one of its
ebiectives. We say “see to present" because, although we have

confirmation From CIRAS that MICLEVE+t5 docs in fact hold the

resition descrihed above, we are of an open mind regarding the
practicability of his use and we are completely willing to accept any
information that would =ilitate against his secure and fruitful employment},

MEMORANDUM FOR AMCLEVE/15‘s File -- 14 August 1967
“ORIGINATOR: Gary L, riUSTIKOFF : a

1. ANCLEVE/15 submitted the attached note, written =.- Jo: o-
-by him, to the writor. -In the note ANCLEVE/15 says Pa Mele!
“he is not asking for anything but wants tho records checked 0
regarding his past salary of $325.00 per month, ANCLEVE/15
Claimed "Chip" (Grover T. LYTUCOTT, his. former CO) told.
him thet effective October 1966 he’ would be paid $106 “
per month by BOFACP4 while the Balanee would be pleced ina Vant for him.

2.. For the record AMCLEVE/15 was told by. the writer _-
and not Chip that effective August 1966 (not October)’: .
he would be cut back in his salary. to approximately ~ .
$100.00 por month.: He was cut back from $350.00, not
$325.00, for reasons of cconemy and cover and he was
agreeable to the cutback. The writer did not tell him
that the balance of approximately $212.00 was being
saved for him; only that his gross salary would be
raised to $350.00 in the event RECK ever stopped paying
him his salary. (It was assumed that his RECE enployrent
might be short-lived). For administrative reasons the -
Salary cutback was not offcctive until September 1966 and
from latter date until December 1966 he was paid $111.13,
From January 1967 until June 1967 he was paid $110.90
due to a FICA change. During the entire period, September
1966 to: June 1967, AMCLEVE/15 was budgeted by JMWAVE in
the amount of $350.00 gross with the notation of his
voucher of "possibility of paying balance later". | Then.
in June 1967 ANCIEVE/15's salary was increased to $350.00
gross, as so promised, bocause he was unemployed | during
most of June. |

° Termination of. AMCLEVE/: Ss.

Action Required: Se
Snunvenns, a July 1967

; Reference:

* orted din. reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated
effective 12 uly 1967. AMCLEVE/1S was terminated because he
resigned from his position as a military coordinator/member of
RECE. (Cuban’ Repre entation in Exile), a Miami based Cuban exile
organization, in-early June 1967 and he thus lost access. to his
target, as ANCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of

_ RECE since 1 August 1966. In addition, JMWAVE does not have a

-@urrent need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT

organization has the capability to penetrate and report on RECE
if and when the need should arise. After AMCLEVE/15 resigned
from RECE, he was a candidate for employment in the AMOT organ-
ization; however, because af his involvement with Frank "Lefty"
ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons it was decided that
the ANOT organization should not hire him.

2. AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April
1965 and initially served as an instructor in the Maritime
Training Branch ‘of JMWAVE. He was also active in reporting on
exile activities. On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred
to the CI Branch where he was used to report on the activities
of RECE until his resignation in early June 1967.

- 3. Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, JMWAVE does
not envision any problems at this time. AMCLEVE/15 plans to
seek employment in Caracas, Venezuela, through an old friend
who resides there.

4%. On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination
bonus of $650.00, which is. equivalent. to two months salary, minus
FICA and federal income tax. He was paid $549.60 net.
