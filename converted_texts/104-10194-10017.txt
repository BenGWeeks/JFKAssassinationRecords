. For: ‘sipproxinately four months during 1967, Mr, Vitale
‘worked with me in providing Headquarters' support to JMWAVE
in its conduct of. ‘special operations into PBRUMEN. In such
a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,
requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable. in (1) the preparation of operational proposals

' for. the 303: Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational

information periodically requested by the front offices of
both WH/€OG-and WHD, and-(3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

~ newly assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations, While

under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,

“cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all

tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner, He always
expressed hiS.willingness to work as many hours as necessary
to finish.the task at hand. He has a very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits.
a good sense of cost consciousness in the use of government

* - equipment and materials. The rating letter "S" most accurately
“ reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As noted in the last Fitness Report,

supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; put I
must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a
more junior clerical type and that Mr, Vitale should not be considered
ag performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. . Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such a role

. and his official position title should be changed to prevent any
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to

the Agency.

4 years, if he does not receive an overseas assignment He has
told the carecr panel, he would accept an overseas assignment

assignment for him than the present one, even though he has been

SECTION C/Continued - NARRATIVE ‘COMMENTS

For approximately four. months during 1967, Mr. Vitale

_ ‘worked with me in providing Headquarters’ support to JMWAVE
in its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such

a role, Mr: Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,—-
requirements and ‘PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable in (1) --thé preparation of operational proposals
for the 303. Committee, (2) +the provision of timely operational

‘information, periodically requested by the front. offices of

both WH/COG and WHD, ‘and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel _
newly assigned to JMWAVE-to assist in these operations. While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,

cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all

,tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner, He always
“expressed his willingness to work as many hours as’ necessary

to finish the task at- hand, He has a very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits
a good sehse of cost. consciousness in the use of government
equipment and materials, . The rating letter "S" most accurately
reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

TOMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but I
must again note that.these.are duties which could be performed by.a
more junior clerical type and that Mr. VitaJe should not be considered
as performing GS-& level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such, a roie
and his official position title should be changed to prevent uly
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value .to

the Agency.

: I have. had opportunity to observe subject's performance closely

for nine months and while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings
of the duties as listed, it should be noted that these same duties could
be performed ecually well by a more junior Intel Clerk or Intel Assistant
and, therefore, the overal) rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not
accurately reflect, his capability. In my opinion it would be very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for subject to perform competitively with other |
Intel Assistants at a GS-8 level, and I recommend his position title be
changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs. capably.

During the past year subject has continued to be a most cooperative,

frustrating, and demands more with less apparent return than most:
projects. As on his previous fitness report, t I have rated him very cee

make name. traces “and ferret out information from the various agency sources
- Concerned. Lo . :

-" He af. all times bas been a most cooperative, loyal and willing worker

. with good security habits. - Althotgh, he does not have the ambition or drive
to get to the top of the ladder that many younger officers may have (not
everytody can or wants to be Chief, but can still ‘be one of the best indians
in the business), ‘bis great: sture of general knowledge and many years of

agency experience ha
his colleagues in the GS-7-9 level, and it is because of this that he
has received such a high rating. Consequently, it is recommended that

Mr. Vitale be promoted to the next higher grade at the earliest opportunity.

This employee had no qualifications for assignment in the German desk or,

The fitness report for the period of his. duty with the German Branch is
accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried
out assigned tasks to the best of his ability. :
