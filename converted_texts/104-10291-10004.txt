I have worked with tits Wericer just 24 months, but’ this has been long
enough to satisfy me that he is above avernge in registry work, He is

a very knowledgeable registry, technician, but most important, he is
“aggressive and imaginative’ in devising new procedures, or revising old
ones to. improve the quality of registry sorvice to this Station, He
4s affable in dealing with his peers and confident and persuasive in
dealing with the senior management of this Station. Shortly after his
arrival he took over the analysing and distribution of the cables, and
prepared a Station procedure for this purpose. Immediately following
that, he devised ea new procedure for handling correspondence and.
installed it.” He had reviewed. the multitudinous files at this Station
and 3 plans.to trim them. back to moré reasonable and appropriate
dimensions. In every respect, this officer has taken cherge of the
tion he is here to perform, and has devoted a great denl-of time,

Mr. Woods first made a survey ¢ of the, Augean stable that the Italian Branch
files had become over many years of shifts in personnel.and changes..of direction,
He then reviewed, downgraded, and rétired approximately 350 Top Secret’ docu-
ments with appropriate Project and Subject files and copies destroyed. At the’
conipletion of this there was not one Top Secret document on the Branch. He devised,
gained approval from Fi/D, and carried out a new procedure for the downgrading of
TYLOTE material from Top Secret to Secret so that it could be retired, He retired
approximately 60 Project, 25 Subject, and fifty 201 files, He surveyed the Commu-

has demonstrated that he merits in full measure the high opinion
of him held by his previous supervisor. Conscientious, careful,
fully knowledgeable of Registry procedures he has gone abdut his
day-to-day tasks in an exceptionally proficient way without the ft
need for constant supérvision. He 1s prompt in his response to
requests and has an excellent sense of "get the job done". He
ig an intelligent and concerned supervisor who has been meticulous
in keeping his supervisors briefed on personnel and other problems
as they haye - arisen in the Station Registry. He appears fully .
capable of: assuming larger. responsibilitios. in the records field.

With, about niineteen months experience managing the station
‘ rogistry already under his belt, his usefulness here increases.
: Ho continues to demonstrate -the same quietly effective leadership
and talent for sound organization in his.own shop as were noted
on the last fitness report. .

While maintaining a high standard in the more routine day-
to-day services and processes a registry is normally expected to.
supply, hé has also been the catalyst for a thorough, carefully
phased and continuing review and, where appropriate, purge of
registry and other | ‘file holdings. Administer ing this ambitious
reduction program requires sound judgment and experience in
handling the detail in our existing records. Subject has these
qualities and has achieved impressive results. To complete
this task, he has asked .to extend his tour here for one yeat
until’ ‘November 1971 anid Headquarters has approved this.

He is invariably completely responsive ‘to guidance. from the
DCOS,. his immediate supervisor, ‘and conscientiously soeks to
achiove the work goals which are identified during our occa-
sional accomplishment and performance consultations. The
spirit of cooperation with which*he deals with other station

personnel: is equally commendable.
No criticism can be made of his security and cover deportment .

Rie So rgytibed, if

This e employee continues to be Chief of the Station Registry. During the past ear .
his level of performance can be properly evaluated as exceptionXtiy proficient. He
continues to welcome hard work, is not bothered by constantly changing deadlines
and is able to fill in for any absent member of his unit, and keep up his own work

as Well, He is quite conscious of the value of Government personnel and rszteriel,
and does everything in his power to conserve these resources. He continues to come
up with new ideas on how to perform his functions in a more efficient and effective
manner. This results in benefits to the entire Station. It is regretable that the

tndicote significant steengths of weaknesses demznst:oted in current position beeping

position this employee fills does not allow for promotion since he has been perform gf

at a level above his present grade for several years.

to bring up ideas for the improvement of his unit. These have.been particularly
welcome during the past year in view of the impending move of the Registry to a new
location at Fuchu_Air Station. The slight tendency to be arbitrary mentioned in the
last fitness report has been eliminated during this reporting period. In view of thia

SUBJECT; _damos 8, WOODS - Recommendation for Promotion

1, Subject has been in grade GS-10 since June 1968,
Based on his outstanding performance as Chief of Registry in
the Rome Station since June 30, 1971, he strongly merits
promotion to grade GS-11 at this time. When Subject took
over the responsibility for Registry a year ayo, he found a
system glutted with paper and bound up by a policy which
discouraged getting rid of it, He Lound many procedures in
foreco which were out of date, if not obsolcto, and proposed -

. stfeamlined procedures, which were adopted, to replace them,

He asked for and was given the responsibility to analyze and
distribute the cables, which had previously been a function
of the Chicf of Station's secrotary, He recommended. the
discontinuance of the abstract system, which proposal had
been adopted by most elements of the Station, He recommended
a reduction in the retention period for cable and dispatch
echronos., With the help of a TDY team here for the first half
of. CY 1972, he devised and instituted a progran of purging
the files, This program has resulted in the disposition of
most of the departed Soviet files, a severe trimming of the
trua name tiles, and the review, reduction and up-dating of
the project and operational tiles, All of this work w
pecompanied by appropriate name cheeks, cotvies on the ludex
cards and echLion of pertinent doctmenis for transmittal to
Headquarters, In summary, Subject performed a thorough "house-
cleaning" of Station records in the full meaning of that ‘phrase,
Subject has

plans for continuing etforts along these lines "which may exceed

Jhis tenure at this Station since he intends to return to Head-

quarters not Jater than May 1974, The on-going program includes

review and reorganization of the subject files, the encrypted

201's and the disposition (hopefully) of about 50 feet of micro-
film, <A corollury to these projects will be o significant
reduction in the index cards, which at present Jead to the micro~
‘ind to other superfluous material we either fiave or will

destroy.

if not prevent the reoccurrence of this pile-up of paper
48 not lost on this officer. He conutantly thinks in terms
of procedures and controls to accomplish this end.

3. Subject is dedicated, highly motivated, con-
scientious, and hard working. He reports to.work cach day
ap hour before the Station opens in order to distribute the
cables by opening of business, He never hesitates to respond
positively to any request for help. Indeed, he solicits

‘work which he believes can be done more easily or more simply

in his unit. In all respects, Subject is a trained, profes-
sional records managoment officer who 4s thoughtful as well’
as enthusiastic about his work,

. 4. It is strongly | recommended that Subject be pro-
noted to grade Gs-11,

FROM

SUBJECT z Promotion Recommendation ~
ON rn Janes S. Woods ‘

Chief of Station, London

-- Subject, who has been in grade as a GS-10 just two years,
has been Chief of the Registry of the London Station for eighteen
months. Subject, fresh from a Saigon assignment, brought with
him a broad axd varied background of ficld experience (Far East)
and several He2dquarters' assignments. He has been in one or
another a5 pe ef records management work since he started with

us as a very junior clerk in 1952,

- Subject’ 6S fitness reports, since -he has been in London,
testify to the Nigh regard in which he is held by the Station
and the excelient results he has managed to achieve. When he
arrived at the Station, the start had been made on a file reduction
program but 2m enormous amount of organized work remained to be
done, Subject set about it with great enthusiasm and a high degree
of professiosz2 organization. As a resuit, the Registry inventory
today is the ieanest and the most efficient the Station has scen
for many a long day, if ever before. To a great extent this can
be laid at Subject's own door and he personally did much of the
work. At th we time, Subject surveyed and reorganized the over-
all workivad oi the Registry and was finally able to recommend to
the Siat nent a reduetion of one Rentatey elork. The
spribler si certainiy required a mere iatensive work ulfert
on the part of istry personnel, which has been attained without
any loss of morale; in fact, quite the reverse, -

Subject, therefore, emerges as a records management officer
who has thorougsly learned his business and a hard-driving,
sympathetic and successful supervisor, In the opinion of the
Station management, Subject is already quite capable of taking
over broader more scuior responsibilities in the records manage-
ment field, in this respect, however, we do not believe he will.
be wasting nis time in London by spending, as he currently plans ‘to
do, an additional year here on the completion of his tour in :
November. The London Registry, reflecting the multi-faceted work
of the Station, is sufficiently complex an operation to warrant



--- Page 245 ---

Subject's continued attention,

In view of his really excellent performance and high promise, t
it 1s strongly recommended that Subject be promoted to GS-11.
