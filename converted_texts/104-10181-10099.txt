i. The following inforaztion about Subject's trip to
Spain and her activities while here was obtained from QUT TIMID
and QUBOZE.

2. Supject arrived in Madrid on 10 February 1976. She
traveled to Barcelona during the week of 23 February and
returned to Madrid 6 March whereupon she then left for Portugal.
She returned to Madrid on 17 March and waited for Guillerno
RUI2 Perez’ return from the Spanish/Cuban Commercial nego~
tiations in Cubs. Sonia departed Madrid tox Cuba en 27 March 1970.
It appears that she intended to travel to Vienna, Austria next,
since several cables were sent to Vieuna from Madrid advisiog
Sonia's travel status. During her stay in Spein, Sonia was in
frequent contact with one Joze Agustin GOYTISOLO ,
Spanish writer in Barcelosa, telephone 228-4063 (Station traces
are OSBA 62385, 17 Februsry 1965; OBBA 02718, 11 August 1967;
aod OSBA 02795, 1 March 1968). She was not known to heave been
in contact with any other locals and what little time she had
for diversion she spent with the mission efficers and their
wives.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

3. The purpose of Seniats trip to Madrid was te discuss
the 1970 work plan for the Embassy with the Charge, Guillermo
RUIZ Perez. She aiso talked with the various Embassy officiala,
most probably to familiarize herself with their duties and to
see if they had any problems. She pitched in and helped with
the backlogged work of Grestee BARR EBA and Horacio
FUENTES and also helped with the cultural activities,
For instance, she sent two cables to MINREX - one regarding
the forwarding cf movie posters for a March exhibit and another
regarding the forwarding of a Cuban stamp exhibition by end
March.

4. In their discussion of the 1970 work plan Sonia told
RUIZ that they were going to plan the February, March, und
April quarter. She showed hia "an agenda for the control of
planned and unplanned activities” and the general directives of
the plan which included scientific information and political
information, with specific directives (requirements) for Spain.
RUIZ has to prepare for Bavans 2 monthly report, then a quarterly
summary, of the activities accomplished. Eased on these
reporta the activities of the following quarter wiil be planned.

a. In Line with the plan of scientific
iuformation, Sonin and RUIZ discussed the pros
and cone of a Comite Ctentifice-Tecnico which
is to be set up In Wadrid- HWY was oF the
opinion that the local (Spanish) Communist
Party would try to infiltrate 4t and this
would bring problews to the Embassy. Sonis
polated out the successes encountered in
Switzerland and Sweden with guch a committee
even though at first there were probleme
woich were later overcowe.

b. Sonia showed RUIZ a commercial project
which she plauned to take to Portugal and
asked him to read it because it wag alo of
interest te the Cuban siseion in Spain.

c. Sonia mentioned that the Plan of
information waa etill to be completed especially
in the priority categeries of Livestock anc
ecenomy.

a. They turned next to the tepic of
the budget. Sonia ssid that the budget
for each mission had to be submitted before
the end of April (every yeur) and no additionsl
expenditures couid he submitted for approvel
duriag the courre of the year. Spain, Canada,
ang France, however, would be treated individually.
Their specinl needs, such as acquisition of
more office space, raises in cost of Living
ailowances, etc., would be taken into consideration
at any time.

VATION OF
DISPATCH S ECHR AT

5. During tiwir various discussions BUIY aired his
complaint ebout the visa Department in Uavana saying that
the departeent was practically worthless and that last year
76 cables regarding visas remained unanswered. Sonia
defended the Ministry saying that it had a tot of work to
do, but RUIZ replied that they wanted to work only & hours
a day. They slso discussed the scholarship situation. it
seems thet during en interview between PRIETO (probably
Jose PRIETO Renitez, Director of Foreign Relationg of
the DAP) and the Minister of Public Worke, PRIETO was asked
to provide a liet of scholership candidetes to be considered
apd he bad none. Sonia gwentioned that in Helgium they aise
lost four scholarships because of this game reagon.

&. According to QUTIMID Sonia GOK EZ Arsgon is
warried to one Miguel (LNU) and has a daughter nawed Dhisue.
Sonia's mother is still living aithough apveared to be very
i411 at the time Sonia left for her trip to Madrid because
Sonia cabled at least twice to Havang inquiring about the
wtetus of her wother’s heeith. (TYLOTE reported that Sonia's
howe phone number in Havana is 7-4263.) Perhaps Headquarters
can determine the full name of her husband by checking the
reverse telephone listings Sonis is attractive, intelligent,
sertious-minced aud reserved. The last time she viaited Spain
she stayed with Vern 8 GRObDOW S KI and was on the same
type of mission ac the present one ~ to discuss the Madrid
Eubassy's work plan. She Silso visited the Barcelonz Consulate
and the Cuban Rabassy in Lisbon.

brusque but sincere, opinionated, strong-minded
idealistic, self-confident. Has basic
emotional instability, gives impression

of being insecure in his position. At times

paradoxically, appears friendly to some people.

limited vocabulary, swears 2 good deal.

EDUCATION:

He can turn on considerable
charm, where motivated. In
contrast to his pleasant public
image and acceptable language,
private conversation is vulgar,
Swears continually and flies into
rages,

Likes good living and spends money
where it shows. Avid reader, keeps
abreast of world events, shows
willingness to accept whatever he
deems to be good or useful from

the outside world. Concerned with

the image and prestige of Cuba in
Spain. Emotionally committed to

an ideal. An AMEDIT study summed
RUIZ up as a realist. He speaks
English and French, His wife, a
teacher, always worked before going
to Spain, and there works as a
secretary and bookkeeper at the
Embassy on an informal basis. Appears
intelligent, competent, outspoken

but solicitious and affectionate with
her husband; interested in, and
encourages him in his work, Appears to
Support the regime, but not a fanatic.
RUIZ is the dominant personality of the
two,

One reference states that he went to
work at age 14, which Suggests lack of
formal education.

In 1960 as an employee of the Ministry
of the Treasury, selected to attend

a statistics course offered by CEPAL,
which lasted two years.

One relative reported he completed
elementary education at "Hermanos
Maristas" school in Havana; did not
know whether he attended high school,
but said in early days of the Castro
regime attended the University of

PREVIOUS POSITIONS:

Havana.

Another relative said his

primary and secondary education

was received in private institutions,
and that he has a degree in “political
economics” from the University of
Havana,

He is well versed in world affairs
and has an understanding of
international trade.

Vice Minister, MINCEX, 1964-1967.

Commercial Counselor, Cuban Embassy,
Mexico City. Although he was
accredited to that position in
December 1963, travel indicates he
was in Mexico from August 1963 to
May.1964. Other references indicate
he was in that position in September
1963.

Ministry of the Treasury. In April
1962 he was Chief of the Department
of Construction Expenses Studies,
Office of Financial Statistics of
that ministry. He was with the
ministry as early as 1960, when he
was selected to attend the statistics
course.

During the Batista regime he was in
exile. Came to the U.S, sometime in
the 1950's and apparently remained for
some time before he left in February
1957, when, according to some reports,
he entered Cuba elandestinely. Also
reported to have been in exile in
Mexico.

LNYUMA records show he came to U.S.

on 8 November 1956 to see his brother,
left 17 November for the Dominican
Republic where he received five months

POLITICAL
ATTITUDE;

U.S. 5 April 1957, overstayed

his time, and on 11 February 1958

was ordered deported: claimed he
would be killed if he returned to
Cuba and did not show for deportation.
Subsequent investigation showed he

was in Cuba as of 2 March.

A member of the Cuban Communist
Party, admitted on the recommendation
of Armando HART Davalos, Sceretary ~
of Organization. Although he has
been de: ibed as a militant Communist,
a convinced supporter of the Castro
regime and a fanatic Pidelista, there
is cvidence to dispute this image,

An analysis of available information
indicates that he is not a convineed
Marxist, he cannot accept Party
discipline, and that his character

is basically incompatible with the
system he serves.

His father is reported to be an old-
suard Communist and a leader of

the barber's union. A brother
reported to be a member of DSE in 1946,

He expressed dissatisfaction with

his position as a diplomat, fecls

his talents are wasted and would like
a position in commerce or industry,
where he considers he could better
serve the revolution. Has criticized
the bureaucracy and ineffieiency in
the government in Havana.

He has said that many Cuban diplomats
want to stay out of Cuba, but it
seemed to him that the Cuban government
wanted to kecp him (RUIZ) out of the
way €i.e., outside Cuba), That LEON
had appointed him, supported him, and
they are good friends, but that he
(RUIZ) dees not like to work with a
man who one dees not get to know,

nor to know what he ts thinking. He
said he felt as if he were in Miami.

timing and the person involved.
