PERIOD covERED: veneers em

Although: I’ have been the Station case éfficer for subject
only since January 19 4, I_have: been acquainted with his performance
for the Station ‘for t é@ past § 1/2 years through my assignment in
the French Branch. at. Heudquarters and,-for the past 2 1/2 years,
as the Station: officer responsible for UNCAIRD operations. Tf
have dlways considered CASASIN to -be' a highly @killéd, experienced
senior case officer thoroughly devoted to the work of BKHERALD.
He 1s becoming increasingly effective in his present. cover position
at UNCALKD, operating against both Soviet and PRC targets, and I
am delighted that he has agreed to continue his couperation with
the Station as a field agent following his retirement from

“BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974, CASASIN can look back with pride

over hia years of service with BKHERALD ‘but he can also look

. forward to additional yeara of highly useful, Productive work for

Parts Station.

CASASIN' 8 attitude can best be summed up- by a comment on ay

. first operational meeting with. hin following his’ official retire-
-, Ment. He instinctively went immediately to a discussion of.

operations, not of retirement. I am confident that CASASIN will
continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station,
and I wish him well.

set forth in the flarrative on this KOC. He is all the things the rater has
» stated and more: highly intelligent, versatile, linguistically extremely. .
+ well qualified, and professionally experienced in his cover role, He has
begun very well to utilize this new cover position on the Organization's
behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that the NOC landed this particular
plea (ia terms of competition for the cover vacancy) ‘solely on the basis of
his own demonstrated: talents in the cover context.

In sun, this is an caperienced, Fective NOC, whose nos cover affords him

an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has
_ begun to exploit this. access in a sound, logical fashion, and the period ahead
' should further document the utility of his _key situation to our operational

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL + -

I concur with the supervisor's ‘letter ratings and with the substance
of his narrative comments. Put’ as sinply-as possible, Subject has done
an outstanding job -in establishing superb access cover; it now remains
for him and the Station to exploit it operationally. On the basis of
his ability during the reporting period to establish meaningful
relationships with target Soviets or tc spot and assess leads to
potential agents who can, Subject's retention is this assignment would
net be justified in terms of costs. The 40% rebate does make this effor
entirely defensible, however, “bur Subject should understand that we
expect nore concrete results now that his cover position has been

improve very. ‘substantial .

: The report notes. that -this officer ‘has conducted a lengthy
dialogue with -an MHHARSH target; it is quite accurate that our
NOC has handied-himself well in a situation where disparity. in
age and background renders the relatiertshin somewhat incongruous.
Nonetheless, accuracy requires that we reseed that the NOC's
interlocutor has: obviously not maintained this ongoing relation-
ship solely for altruistic motives, and has, in point of. fact,
on one: occasion Suggested that the NOC night wish to "help" hia
in the preparation of restricted distribution reports oh the

“local situation, even though the particular topic was in itself

totally innocuous. For these reasens we continue to monitor
this relationship with great care, particularly since we simply
cannot assess its longer Tange | vi fability and the direction it

‘is’ likély to take. ~~ :

_In sum, the NOC has done. the best ne could under somewhat
trying circumstances, exacerbated by the severe economic problens
‘of his erstwhile employer, which led ta the NOC's ‘being separated
from that: position at the end of last year. Through his own
efforts, the NOC learned of the vacancy for which he has ‘applied,
and by assiduous and discriminating manipulation of his extensive
connections on the local scene, has managed to maneuver himself
into becoming the lesdirg candidate fer the post. If he is
accepted for this position, his value to the Organization will
unquestionably increase by a quantum leap, and we are consequently
optimistic concerning his future ability. to make an impressive
contribution to Organizational goals on the local scene.

on his ow merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful

’ substantial amount of time and energy from Siect, and the unanswer-
able question at th moment relates to his availability for Organiza~

subject's reporting has been ot ifactory and continue to :
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to
*digest" tae intormation contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful —
with operational expenses™ ‘and has exercised good sécurity.

During the pariod under raviow, additional efforts have been
_-made to make full use. of ‘Subject’ 3 potential and integrate hin:
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly bla asset forthe ‘Stat ion~programs . :

substantial, In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,
althougi “our initial inpressions are favorable.

. On the fitness report itself, this rater would have przrerred
an "8° rating for specific duty nmmber one; Subject may ultimately

~ ‘deserve an "0", but it dees not ssem warranted at the present time.,

Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "P° category, rather than °S",
"but it is-of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
_ who is more intimately and directly involved with subject ‘on a

frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will revaal to
what extent the cover requirements perisit a full measure on be=
half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely
and will be commenting upon it subsequently as we gain experience
and knowledge.

* (a) are essential to the continued existence and security of the.
cover mechanism as a vehicle for operational exploitation , and |

(b) are not necessarily visible to those “on the inside." .

_ In the case of (a), I must engage in a constant orchestration of
the cover and the facilities it offers. This means maintaining

managers of the cover corporation lwac a ©
have to be satisficd that their demands are met (or cannot be
else manipulated in order to neutralize or reject their demands.
After all, the cover position is to thém a.lecitimate, normal,
workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding,
it follows, must be accemplished according to the high standards
of thoroughness and’ accuracy which they have set. .

\e be so demanding that the necds of the CS could no longer -be- served, -

its value to the CS, This means planning, @irecting and
managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of

of informative; directive, and persuasive writing. Tho echedule was fall, although
I boliove it could have besn fuller, the five Zhour workshops ehould be expanded

40 hours, part-time 18 students
Studer: Jacques Richardson = Year of birth: 1924
EOD Date: September 1956° “Grade: 14 Offies: sR

COURSE OBJECTIVES ~ CONTENT AND NETHODS
The Management Course is designed to familiarize scnior line and

* staff managers with: ‘both the theory and the practical problems of

mandgerient in CIA. “The Underlyirg assumption of the course is that
management development is a process of growth on the jche The course,
however, enables the rarticipants to exsmine their job acti: vities in

an environment. -where, gaided by the instructors, they can critically
examine their own actions, exchags idsas with managers from other
components, and develop an understanding of the complex rolationchips
that exist auong the people, the pattarn of organization, aud the
purposes of the Agencye The course approaches the problems of
“management in the Agency by discussing the formal and informal structures,
concepts of leadership and comrunication, the problens of personnel
management, and theories of planning and controlling. These subjects

are related as closely as poysible to the activities of the class members.

The content of the course is developed through lectures, case and
group discussions, filmed presentations, and problem-solving exercises.

aided materially, He drew freely on a sound operational background
and was by ‘all odds.the top student,

2. Student Presentation: Mr. Richardson presented a case with
which he was familiar from his ovn experience. It was a first-rate
performance. The material was very well organized and crisply pro-
sented. So effective in fact, that Mr. Richardson will be called
upon to give the same discussion in subsequent CE courses,

CASASIN's dependents took physical exaninat ions at the
American Hospital in Paris on 20 February. ‘Since, because of -
. his cover there could be no LNHARP connection, CASASIN's dependents
: made arrangements for their physicals as private citizens, on the
a , pretense that they required statements that they were in goad
health in order to obtain insurance. Obviously, forms RQ were not
prepared; the attached certificates of good health and freedan

individuals in France. We hope they suffice.

representatives corporation, service, or wanagenent consultant's
