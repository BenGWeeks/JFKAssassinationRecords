GAQUATIC/LIONION Pulse Camera

ACTION REQUIRE - REFERERCES ©

Actions See paragraph 5.

1, The LIONION Pulse Camera has been working for well over a
year with no major technical problem. A few months ago the 100 Foot
film magazine had to be repaired because the supply spindles had
tightened and put an excessive strain on the motor.

2. More recently, the battery supply had dropped to about
22.5 volts or so causing erratic operation, The sensor relay between
the VLS-2 and the camera suffered the most because of chattering and
- consequent ly arcing between the points..

3, To prevent failures of this type in the future, Raymond L.
BARCENAS is making a small battery charger at a nominal cost that
can be Floated across the batteries keeping them fully charged.
We are doing it this way rather than ordering a OC power supply
because it Is less expensive than a conmercial mode! and will not
be bothered by house current Interruptions or fluctuations, If
however, WOACRE/PB foresees any problems by doing it this wav, please

inform us.
&. On a recent visit to LIONION and a check of the equipment,
it was found that the lens of his FOCOMAT IC enlarger has a fungus
like smudge between the elements. We cannot detect any degradation
in print quality but would like p have a new one in case this is a
fungus and it gets worse. |
» in summation it is requested that WOACRE /PB provide the ,
following to Mexico City, charge 7135-2403.

ACTION PEQUIRED - REFERENCES.

Reference: MEX1-3960

oo. . Ln, r

- 1.) The attachment contains the defective 35mm Pulse Camera
previously reported in referenced cable. Very little agditltonal
information can be supplied, concerning this mechanical faflure,
other than that reported In the reference. This particular camera
was Installed on 16 June.1965 and operated norma} ly from that date
until the afternoon of 28 June, at which tlme It began to continually
blow fuses. Hugh T. FRANCOTTE entered the LIONION Photographic
basehouse that alght, and when it was found that the problem could
not be corrected on the scene, the camera was removed and taken to
MKCHARITY for further troubleshooting. tt was finally discovered
that the shutter motor was malfunctioning and partially burned-out.
Joseph M, RESCIGNO stated that since there was a definite *short™
in the motor, this would cause the camera fuses to constantly blow.

2. Also Included In the attachment are two (2), one hundred
foot capacity, film mayatines. Both of these magazines are faulty,
causing the film to jam, They were both In use with the previous
Pulse Camera which became inoperative during late May and was
forwarded to KURIOT Headquarters for repair. FRANCOTTE had two (2)
new magazines In stock, and they were issued to LIONJON/I-for use
with the camera presently being returned for repair or replacement.

| ACTION REQUIRED . REFERENCES.

. I, At the time of Hugh T. FRANCOTTE's departure ‘from Head=
quarters; KURIOT had recently begun an extensive evaluation of
the Nikon closed circult television system. Uf thts particular
system Is now considered “operational, FRANCOTTE wishes to be.
so advised, as there may he a-posstble apptication for tt tn
support of. an operation at the Mexico City Station. Lawrence F,
BARKER was recently briefed. by FRANCOTTE on the Nikon system,

and Is now Interested in obtalning additional facts concerning it.
BARKER, who is responsible far the LIONION Project, foresees 3.
possibility for Its use In the LIONION photographic basehouse..

2. It was thought that perhaps the system could be further
“operatlonally tested" at thls baschouse, and at the samp time,
the Staton could examine the possibility of a permanent) Instal-
lation, Presently, LICNION/T Js utilizing a Balscope a Pentax
camera for obtaining photographic coverage of the entrante to the
PBRUMEN Embassy. Provided the television camera could be equipped
with a telephoto lens of about the same focal length as tine
combination of the Balscope and 20X eyepiece, this system might
be a sultable substicute for the equipment now In service. .

3. tt Is requested that the Mexico City Station be advised
if the Nikon television system Is available, and Headquarters a.
thoughts concerning the testing of It at the LIONION basehouse.
