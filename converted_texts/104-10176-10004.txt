1, Forwarded under separate cover are twelve reports prepared by
Uabasee be AGG vie dhe Sccavities Os Liniiw73, Lialwss ane contacts of
the latter.

2. The main topic covered in RO.TON's reports is LIRING~4's efforts to
obtain help fa getting LINING"3 out of fail in Guaterale 2s soon as yossible,
LIR@TNG"4 is almost penniless (AUATON bes wade only tozen paymeats to her
after i5 Juce) and hes been mving fro: one apartment to a cheaper one living
on the saic of paintings left by LIRING?3 and saali loans frem ieftist contacts.
In the hoze that she may de able to do something for LiZiG°3, LIRING-4 has
resisted all of RCUTCu's efforts to sez her to undertaxe a claatestine aissioa
to PEZUHEN, a mission, as Headquarters xnows, was pieaneé long ago. As a
foreizaer, LIRING-4 cannot work in Mexico without taking the chance of being
deported, if caught. Aithough she has not tried it, she would prodadiy de
refused a visa to go to Guatezala to visit LIRING*3. She nigac also face
difficulties in Guatemala including possible detention and interrogation if
she succeeded in obtaining an entry perait to that country. ~

3. By mid-September 1968 LIRING-S had ceceived very little telp fron
her Mexican leftist or outright Communist frierds. In spite of procises to
try to oribe the Guatensian judge scheduled to try LISZiNG-2 all LIRING@4's
"Eriends” succeeded in doing was to print several articles in the loc2i press
(some of thea with LIRING*3's photo) cleising thet LIRTNG93 wes unjustly

articles did litrle to preisdice the Gustexalans ia favor of LIXING“3.

As a matter of fact, the letcer who saccecded in sending LIZInG4 a: fev

letters via the Mexican Consul in Guetetala City who comes to visit |hia in

jail, recently ciained thet he wea szved from 6 prison "transfer" by the .
Guatenslen erey hy the arrival of the Mexican Consui. LIRING*3 viewed this
"cransier™ purely and siuply as an execution ettempt.

4, LIRINC4 received even less help from LIRISG who told her that
- - - 4 there was nothing it could co to help LIAING"3, LIEING@4, on the advice
contained in one of the notes sent from prison by LIRING*3, kept avay fron - .
LIRING und its employees until she met LIRING-10 by accident at theloffice
of one of the leftist papers on 27 Jai LINING“10 convinced her to resure
fer visits to LIRING. That the local UMENs still have doubts about
LIRING*3 despite his imprisonment in Gusteasaia is indicated by the statements
. cade by Rodolfo REYES (see EOKTON's 17 Jzly report) to the effect that the
latter would not be willing to help LIRTG-3 until be found our on whet :
side of "al griego" (ROWION uncer faise identity) he was, REYES added that :
LIRING suspects the "griego™ of KOZIRM connections, although it has no
definite proof of this.

5. Statezencs suen as those mace by anieS confira the Sscacioa’s celieZ

thet LIRING, upon orders froa hore, is still attempting to investigate
, FOsTON. Such statements aleo re-enforce the cecisica of the Stacior. not to
attespt, through liaison, to odtain the release of LERING?3. Such an ~ ”
attempt, 1£ is leaked, woulé not oaly se LIRING*3 to PSRUYEN and
Guatemalan FAR reprisals, {t would prob2dly also have adverse repercussions
on BOwON's security, LIRIVG+11 whom ROsTON met briefly oa 5 July (see
g about LIZING’3's arrest whea

ROWTOX's repor: dated 9 Culy) said nothing
. ROWPON corplained that mail which he said he sent ‘to LIRINS"3 resained .
{ : unanswered, It is also to de noted that REYES, who of course knows that
po LIRING?4 is in Yexico, told SG:TCN chat she was probably in #3KUZEN. Tis . .
oy shows clearly the distrust with which LI&iNG views SONTON. ate wine .

nist

Ministry of Cul a i oat the invitztion of the Mésican C
LAMP ALD ros. Sy aid-Sepcexser, la fact, Sv
was staying at LiRins@4's aparcmeat aithough LIRING-+ clained to ROWTON chat
there was no rozancing between the two and that SUAREZ uses her apartment

. because he was too broke to get one of his own, In view of LIRING*4's

. assessment of SUAREZ as very leftist and pro-AMTEJG1 no effort was made to
it approach bia, - :

7. Contacts between RCWION and LIRING-4 have taken place with decressing

frequenty because the usefulness of LIRING~4 to WOFISM has sharply decreased

znd because LIRING@4 is more and more ccavinced that ROJTON cannot or will

not help her obtain the release of LIKING@3. In her frantic efforts to ¢o

a something for LIRING?3, LIRING?4 has in fact not had any contact with RONTCN

: since early September, Unless LIRING@3 {s released by the Guatemalan

-- - authorities or receives only a light sentence keeping him in jail only a short

time longer, it is doubtful chat LIRINS-S will be of euch use to ROWION and :

Action Required: FYI
Reference : HiOMA-34484, 16 April 1968
1. Forwarded under separate cover are eleven contact

revortg on the setinitine of UTOINC. 2 onl 4 fon the porsoa
1 April to 10 Hay 1968 prepared by Waliace B. ROWTON.

2, The main points covered in ROFTON'’s reports are::

a. LIRING~3's association wich Guatemalan rebels
in Mexico City, his departure for Guatemala and his —
arrest and sentencing there; °

b. Tks reaction of friends of LIRING-3's and
LIRING contacts to the neve of his arrest:

ec. LIBING-4's efforts to “caee" the offices of .
the LIRING Consulate, particularly the "safe rooe", ©
and;

: d. The obvious provocations of LIRING-4 by
Sergio VALDEZ.

3. The product of LI2ZING-4's efforts to case the ~
LIRING consulate will be revieved in a separate dispatch
which will also transmit floor plans and dravirgs of that
LIRIXG cosponent. There is little question that the -1ews
of LIBING-3's arrest in Guatemala gained LIRING-4 the syn
pathy of various menbers of LIRING including LIRING-3, -9
and -16. They seez to understand LIRING-4‘'s desire to post
her departure for PSRUMEN after having received her long awaited
PBRUMEX visa. The problem now is to have LIEING=-4 leave for bo
PBRUMES while LIRING=-3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala. As
mentioned in a recent cable, ROWION has encouraged LIRING=4's,
plans to try to visit LIRISG-3 in jail in Guatemala City as :
ROWTON feels that LIRING-3 will probably urge LIRING-4 to
spend in PBRUMEN at least some of the time he has to spend in
jail. As for the conduct of Sergio VALDEZ (see ROWION's reports
dated 19 April and 6 May), it appears that the latter has delib-
erately been provocating Liginc-4. As this Station sees it,
VALDEZ's purpose was to try to “shake up” LIZING-4 in the absence
of LIRING-3 to test her reactions sotfal that be acted
had ho aaa atriatin Sone bin em 2 ~
indication that he ney have been doing” this for the PBRUMEN‘s
(although this is no doubt a possibility). The Station is look=
ing into the desirability, at this point, of placing VALDEZ
under surveillance. The claim that ROWION in alias offered
Carmen LOZADA i certain sum oz roney for intelligence information
in PBRUMEN has no foundatioa.

2, According to reports subnitted to Wallace B. ROWTON ly
LIRING-3, the latter s<t Carlos Manuel Persaval ¥Yarcue origiqally
through the latter's sister-in-lay, Carmer*Lozada de Ramirez;
who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair with LIRING-3
Since early November i3¢7. On the evening of 3 March 1968, *
Persaval approached LIRING-3 in connection with the sssftavie

ie

that a young Guatemalan woman living in Mexico City was havi
in ovtaining false docusentation'to enable her to travel to
Guatemala to recontact her husband, whom Persaval described as
“an important guerrilla leader". Persaval revealed to LIRIN
that he had been assisting the FAR in propaganda work in Mexico
for some time and gave LIRING-3 several copies of a pamphlet !
eatitled "Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been
published cn one of his uncle's presses and was being sold at the
nominal price of three Méxican pesos to help raise money for ithe
FAR, 1

3. When LIRING-3. under ROWION's direction, responded

favorably to this initial approe-a, Persaval pursued the matter
and finally, on 8 April, reveals. ‘that he was in touch with two
“eportant gucwsille leade.o” suv necueu erp im returning ‘
clandestinely to Guatemala. Persaval asked LIRING-3 to arrange
to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of
Chiapas, an area LIRING-3 had previously told Persaval he was very
familiar with from his previous residence in Sar Cristobal.
Persaval made no further reference to the “young Guatenzlan wife
of the FAR leader”. LIRING-3 surmised to ROWTON that this person
might actually have been the wife of Francisco Lara Barrios, but
that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip
by Lara himself.

4. At ROWTON's urging, LIRING-3 insisted on reeting the tvo
Guatem2zlans involved and in talking to them before undertaking
such a mission. Persaval finally introduced LIRING-3 to Francisco.
Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIRING-3
to a certain “Rodolfo, who LIRING-3 ascertained subsequently was
a member of the 13th of November group headed by Yon Sosa by the
name of;Sandoval. Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIRING-3
that he had in his possession a false Guatemalan passport in the
nare of Jose Maria‘Oliva Carranza and that he had obtained legal
residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts
of ex-Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas. He also named 2 certain
Eskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons wio assisted Guatemalan exiles
-in Mexico, Station believes Eskenazi may be identical with
Luis DavidfEskenassy Cruz, a former agent of the Guatemala City
Station. °

5. With the approval of ROWTON, LIRING-3 agreed tol help
the above-mentioned persons to cross the Mexican/Guatemailan border
and to accompany them to Guatemala City. This latter extension of
the original trip was made by Lara at the suggestion of LIRING-3
so that the latter could meet with the FAR woman responsible for
logistics, _LIRING-3 reported to ROWTON subwequently that just
before their departure, Lara also offered to arrange for LIRING-3
to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to meet directly
with FAR and 13th of November leaders to discuss s comereiai
that LIRING-3 might be able to provide through his co ial
contacts in Chiapas and northern Mexico.

6. “LIRING-3 fabricated a false Mexican identity d nt
(Secretaria. ‘de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the
name of Jacinto/Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disgiised so
that tke latter could move about more unobtrusively on the Mexican
side of the border just prior to crossing. On 3 April 1958, |
just prior to their scheduled departure date, Francisco Lara

informed LIRING-3 that their mutual friend Rodolfo Sandoval.
would not be accozpanying them since he was too vell Known and
his mission was not important enough to justify the risk and the
expense involved.

7. \LIRING-3 did not depart as he had hoped on 5 April 1968,
because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle
on the norning of that day while cleaning his gus and had to be.
given medical attention before he could make the trip. LIRING-4
told ROWION that LIRING-3, Francisco Lara and Razl/Moreno, a
friend of LIRING-3, finally left Mexico City in the personal
car of Raul Moreno on 10 4pril 1958. but that Moreso had returned .
to Mexico City two days later as a result of an-eccident that
disabled the car sorewhere in Chiapas. LIRING-4 did not report
anything concerning the subsequent involvement of Carlos Persaval
Marcue, stating that she rad not received any ccmnunication fron
LIRBING-3 after his telegram of 12 April, in which te reported
the return of Raul Moreno. 2Z0¥TON surmises that when Raul
Moreno kad to return to Mexico City. LIRING-3 azd Lara asked
Carlos Persaval Marcue to join them and drive trem to the border
Sn hic om cor acd thet Persaval cantinued on with them toward

Guatemila City. : :

8. Guatemala City Station advised on 22 April 1968, that | -
the story of the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LIZING-3 had reached .
the local press and that they would be turned over to the appro-
priate courts for trial. This indicates that LIRING-3 may :
eventually be released and hence be available to ROWION for 1
complete debriefing. .

9. The only significant naxe that had surfaced as a result
of LIRING-3's involvement with the Guatemalan reseis in Mexico
City is that of Rolando”’Mendez Aguilar, whom Francisco Lara '
Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from
the home telephone of LIRING-3. (This number corresponds to the ...
*Publicaciones e Inpresiones Mexicaras. S.A. - Diario Cvaciones, .
Calle Lago Sirahuen 297, Mexico Citr). From the LIFEAT covera2ge -
on LIRING-3 it is apparent that Mencez is a close contact of
both Lara and Sandoval and may be providing or btave provided
employrent for them in Mexico. The Station is attempting to
determine the home address of Mendez in the hope that further
details of his possible collaboration may be uncovered. |

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: LIRING-3 Visit To Guatemala With Guerrillas

FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARRA BARRIOS and CARLOS’
MANUEL PERSAVAL MARCUE .

1. On 5 March 1968, LIRING-3 had dinner with CARLOS |
PERSAVAL MARCUE, nephew of MANUEL MARCUE PARDINES, director
of the now defunct magazine “POLITICA”, a Cozzsunist bi-
monthly publication. During the dinner PERSAVAL queried
LIRING-3 if he could obtain a false passport for the wife
of an important Guatemalan guerilla leader so that she:
COULS tiaecl feu Reaicy LU ULatek-ta, Lininu-3S replied
that he would do his utmost to assist.

2. On 8 March 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two(2)
Guatemalan revolutionaries had need to travel to Guatemala
by mid-March. LIRING-3 commented that there was limited
possibility of obtainirg false documents, but that he could.
brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitate their illegal
crossing of the Mexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,
he would guide them.

q .

3. On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the matter
-with LIRING-3, saying that one of the two travellers possessed
‘- legal travel documents. Since the other person has no such ‘
legal documents, they should enter Guatemala illegally,
f MEXI-479077 i

4. \LIRING-3 reported on 27 March 1968, that one of the
traveller to Guatemala is FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS,
The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to
Guatemala in order to meet an unidentified woman, described
as the FAR logistics officer, to discuss FAR support from
Mexico. |

/-MEXI-50007 ; |

5. Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-
inflicted gun shot wound while cleaning a weapon. On 10 April
_ : LIRING-3, LARA, and another person--described as a member of
pee eh ee: - the YON SOSA Faction--departed en route to Guatemala, i
LIRING-3 was informed that the FAR and the YON SOSA group
are now working together, but that a certain amount of
compartmentation exists. :

case of LIRING-3/LIRING-4 the situation is further complicated
by the fact that PBRUMEN nationals at home and in LIRING (the
main target against whom the two have been directed) have -
long suspected their motives for maintaining contact and
wanting to cooperate with them. The ups and dowus of the
LIRING-3/LIRING-4 marital relations have from time to time
further complicated the conduct of operations involving them.
The Station can understand that Headquarters has some reser-
vations on the conduct oi these operations. They have been
complicated, time consuming, and have blown hot and cold
depending on the state of mind of the PBRUMENers at the time
and the difficulties between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. Because
of incomplete control, an almost inescapable feature of this
type of operation, a considerable effort was made to check
the reliability of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. This involved ,

surveillance by the LIEMBRACEs. The results, at least in the
PBRUMEN phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so-
far. The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 has been:
a) as access agents to LIRING, (although this has been l
largely reduced to the LIRING Consulate), and b} to introduce

Wallace B. ROWTON to visiting PBRUMEN officials and members|

of the local leftist community with access to PBRUMEN and ;

LIRING. A major effort was started recently to take this

operation up one more notch and, taking advantage of a recent

cris.s in the relations between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4, send

the iatter to PBRUMEN on a mission to assess and hopefully

recruit new sources of information. The exploitation of

LIRING-3's coutacts with representatives of the Guatemalao

FAR rebel movement was the object of separate correspondence.
LIRING-3's renewed contacts with these representatives do.

not at this time involve PBRUMEN, although the latter clearly .
supports at least some of their activities. : .

2. Yorwarded under separate cover are fifteen reports
prepared by Wallace B, ROWTCN on the activities of LIRING-3,
TERTNG-4, and enews anf their contacts from late Januarv to
31 March 1968. ‘The Station has noted Headquar‘ers' desire
for more frequent progress reports per reference A. It felt,
however, that in this case partial reporting of LIRING-4's
difficulties in obtaining a PBRUMEN visa (by far the most
important aspect of this: operation during the period under
review) could have been misleading, as the situation changed
several times and LIRING-4 did not really know what to expect
from LIRING from one meeting with its representatives to the
iraxt, not to again mention the ups and downs of the LIRING-3/
LIRING-4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period.
The Station would like to point out in passing that, in.
addition to cable reporting and dispatches transmitting:
ROWTON's contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3
and LIRING-4 are involved in are reviewed in sone detail in
the over-all monthly report submitted by the PBRUMEN Section
of this Station.

3. The last time LIRING-4 accompanied LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN,
she obtained an entry visa in a few days. LIRING-4 thus felt
that as an ex-enployee of LIRING with good connections in
PBRUMEN and LIRING she would obtain a new PBRUMEN entry' visa
fairly easily. Entry visas are now quite a bit more difficult
to obtain, however, for PPRUMEN nonofficial citizens abroad.
It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know
what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN
for an extended period of time, as this was obviously based
‘on a domestic quarrel. LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 have had other
quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last
one would subside and that LIRING-4 would postpone or cancel
her plans for going to PBRUMEN. It was to convince the LIRING
staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious ‘that,
LIRING~3. first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further
convince the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING-2 ard
LIRING-9, that LIRING-4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as
a result of domestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3
openly question LIRING-4's right to take their child with
her. It must be remembered that, in “exico, «a wife cannot
leave the country, and especially take a child with hes,
without the express and official consent of the husband. This
little scenario appears to have been well played. On Ves
other hand, it did not help LIRING-4 obtain a visa any faster.
LIRING-2 appeared to be waiting, among other things, for
LIRING-3 to arrive at a decision regarding their child jaccept-
able to his wife. LIRING-3 finally "agreed" to let LIRING-4
take the child at his 26 February meeting at LIRING. Two
days before, LIRING-4 had been told by LIRING-2 that _ the

‘

“consejo superior” of LIRING, of which he said he was a member,
had not yet taken up her case. This was indirectly confirmed
by LIRING-16, who told LIRING-4 the same day that nothing ~
about her visa case had yet been sent to PBRUNEN as he would

otkeipisc Kuov it, cinco he handled 212 vis. correspondence.

4. There is naturally the possibility that LIRING-4's
visa request was handled by LIRING via classified correspondence
not seen by LIRING-16. This channel may have been used because
LIRING-4's visa request brought out the old problem of
LIRING-3's reliability in the eyes of the PBRUMYENers. Although
LIRING-2, LIRING-9, and Idertity appeared sympathetic toward
LIKING-4 and her projected visit to PBRUMEN (to the point
where they advised her on nore than one occasion not to come
back to Mexico), they, at the same tire, sought to clarify
two things. They first made another attempt to throw some
light on the sources through which LIRING-3 had obtained
information of particular interest to LIRING. Secondly they
brought up the question of "the Greek” (ROWTON) and tried to
obtain answers to pertinent questions. LIRING, as mentioned
by pOth LIKLNG-Z2 and luenlity, i> uve uscd wo uciug Bavce
sensitive information without at the same time obtaining good
source description. Specifically, how did LIRING-3 hear of
the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case
4n 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the
press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the -
report on Rico GALAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could
he have learned of certain of the activities of Moises OROZCO
Leal? To all these questions LIRING-3 replied by saying that
he had good sources in Mexico and Ceatral America and that he
was not about to divulge tnem to the PBRUMENers. Both LIRING~-2
and Identity in their conversations with LIRING-3 and LIRING-4
took pains to say that LIRING-3's conduct in his dealings
with LIRING and PBRUMEN was “above reproach." They wanted to ,
be sure, however, that he "had not fallen victim to unscrupulous
elements constantly surrounding the revulutioa." To quote the
old cliche, LIRING-3 "got their message."

5. ROWTON’s introduction to LIRING-2 and other LIRING
members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings
‘with LIRING-2 were bound to make the latter sonewhat curious
about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of
"the revolution” who seems to travel extensively and appears
to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts
of the world. LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON's
criticism of the LIRING efficiency (see ROWTON's report dated
1 January sent as an attachment to reference B) since he

_ finally phoned ROWTON's "office" after the incident described
in ROWTON's 1 January report. For some reason LIRING-2 made
the call on a legal holiday when offices are usually closed,
and the operator of ROWTON's answering service answered
"Mr. ROWTON's (in alias) office." This apparently made
LIRING-2 even more inquisitive. During a one hour meeting
at LIRING on 15 February LIRING-2 asked LIRING-4 about her
relationship with "the Greek." LIRING-2 wanted to know where
and for whom he worked, et cetera. ROWTON's report of
17 February covers this conversation in detail. LIR{NG-2:
appeared to suspect ROWTON may have been one of the sources
of the information passed LIRING by LIRING-3 and warned
LIRING-4 "to go easy with the Greek,” if not for herisake, at
least for LIRING-3, who "has not always treaded on firm ground."
LIRING-4 provided some "information" on her Greek acquaintance
on 24 February. ROWTON, who had briefed her in detajl on what

'
she should tell LIRING-2, felt, after listening to LIRING-4's!
report, that the latter had at least partly succeeded in : }
lessening LIRING-2's suspicions. These suspicions may have
been further reduced after LIRING-3's discussion with LIRING-2
on 26 February. ROWTON did expect LIRING-2's questions and }
felt in the end that he had “passed the test."

6. The Station does not know at this point whether
LIRING-4 will get a PBRUMEN entry visa but is still optinistid
that she witl. The PBRUMENers appear convinced that there is:
serious trouble between her and LIRING-3, and LIRING-1, to
whom LIRING-4 wrote for help recently, asked her to be patient,
pointing out that red tape in PBRUMEN taxes time. The i
possibility that the PBRUMENers may allow LIRING-4 in their ,
country to interrogate her about the activities of her husband
and some of her friends has occurred to ROWTON and the Station.
Such a possibility is, however, most unlikely as the object
of the PBRUMEN suspicions is LIKING-3 and net LIRING-4, who
has several times told them that she knows little of what
LIRING-3 does. The most important consider*tion, however, is
that LIRING-4 is married to a Mexican citiz.a, and as
suspicious as they may be of the latter's doings, the

ppvireverc howe, to the beet of cut brottetrs, no preot that

this Mexican has done anything against their regime. On the
contrary, LIRING-3 has time and again warned them of impending
difficulties or problems. The fact that LIRING-4 is married
to a Mexican and that she enjoys the status of immigrant in
Nexico is also the best assurance that she would be allowed
to return to Mexico, as the PERUMENers want no trouble with
the Mexicans. The SGSWIRL exanination recently given LIRING-4
has cleared the air at least on two points. First, that
LIRING-4 is not an enemy penetration, and, second, that she
has not revealed the nature and extent cf her contacts vith
ROWTON to anyone else than LIRING-3. The Station agrees with:
ROWTON that LIRING-4 would, if given a chance, prove herself
to be a good asset. As for the question of being left with
continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRING-3 anda
LIRING-4 know that there is little ROWTON could do beyond :
providing legal-type advice to bring LIRING-4 back to Mexico '

if the PBRUMENers refused to allow her to return to her husband,

an unlikely possibility as mex*tioned above in view of current
Mexican/PBRUMEN relations. The letter of understauding signed
by LIRING-4 specifies the extent of ROWTON's commitment and
leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations. .The
Station hopes that LIRING-4's relationship with LIRING-3 will
not improve with time to the point where she will lose the
proper motivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUMEN
for which she has been trained and briefed.

%. The attempt made te exploit Carmen LOZADA's trip to

-PBRUMEN to obtain assessments and vulnerability information

on a number of persons she knows who have operational potential
turned out to be a complete failure. LOZADA ran into such .
difficult family problems in PBRUNEN that she had no time (or;

of her. The strain of her personal problems was such that

‘she-nearly had a nervous breakdown after returning to Mexico-

ROWTON did not fare much better with Rodolfo REYES Cortes, i

him at least partially on his contacts in PBRUMEN. The only |
concrete result of REYES' trip to PBRUXEN so far is the contact
which he made with Sukendah**HANAFI, the ex-Ambassador of \

onesia in Havana. According to REYES, BANAFI expressed
rest in meeting ROYTON to “work something out" to tke |
mutual 2dvantage of boih the Greek and Indonesian revolutions.
After a couple of phone calis, it turned out, however, that
HANAFI would probably be unable to obtain a Mexican entry visa.
The Station believes, anyway, that little would be gained vy |
ameeting. From the information at hand, HANAFI is a convinced
leftist who does not lack for money and seems to have an!
enjoyable life in PBRUWEN. The Station is finally not !
interested in the Indozesian “revolution” or in what HANAFI
could do to help the Greek leftists. : |

to further exploit the antagonism LIRING-4 has developed for
the personnel of LIRING in the course of her attempts to.
obtain a PRRUMEN visa to obtain additional operational ~—

Was not at all necessary and that it vas simply just a question of <nowing
a little core about the sources available to L/3 and abou: the "Greek". L/3
coniuded with a statement that i/2 must im tae last analysis weigh the en-
tire affair in terms of whether L/3 in fact had ever done anyt:\ing ageinst
the revolution. i/2 replied without hesitation that everyone felt that L/3
had always acted in good faith and h-d the best of intentiogs. It was simpl
“that they felt that L/3 might have becone a victim of a provocateur without
realizing it. :

4, L/2 then stated that he had no objection to giving L/4 an entry perait
but he hozed that L/3 was not just trying to solve a domestic: problem by
sending her back to her mother. L/3 replied that there was in fact a serious
domestic problem snd confessed th t he had had an affair with another woman -
which L/4 had disccvered but he felt tais was a very personal problem about _
which 1/2 should not be concerned. L/2 replied that he asreed with this and
waa concerned siuply avout the child whe he felt L/a shoukd be ‘pernittee

_ to take with ber. 1/3 tcld Rowton that he finally conceded to 1/2 that per-

haps he was right and that he should te more consicerate of L/4 and perait
her to take the child to .iavana. L/3 told Rowton that the agetine with L/2
ended on a-rather cordial note end that be had the impression that 1/2 would
grant L/4 the re-entry permit without furcher deaday. |

the Mexicans in procuring sulphur and cther critical sroducts, but ‘she

might be seeing the Greek once more before he left for curope again. L/e

replied vh:t he appreciated what she had already obtained ard added that he

felt it wise in these cases to get to know the person "nore and nore” before 5

1. at 1030 on 17 Fedruar,,1963, LIHINC/4 inforzred kowton that she had
Gropped into the LiaiiG offices at about 1230 on 15 february and egein

on the norning of tne following day to check with iIRLiG/2 concerning
-her entry permit for travel to Havana. Cn the first oceasioa LIRI:.G/2
asked ker casually shether she had seen anything of the "@reek friend"
lately. LIkLG/4 tcld nowton that she replied that she and LIkIiG/3 heard
from him from time to time, mainly by telephone, and that he had invited
her out cccasionally, out she,lIK-2.G/4, had turned hin down.

LInine/2 sew L/4 ezein on the precises and asked to not to leave until
she ad seen him, since he wanted to discuss something with her. ihen she ~
finally saw him in his office some 30 cinutes later, he again asxed whether
she had seen the "Greek", not mentioning Rowton by bis alias (Berris).
Since 1/2 hed mentioned L/4's Greek friend whom he had met through Zedolfo
Reyes on a previously occasion, LIni..6/4 felt she could not pretend «ot to
know about whom be was talking. She therefore replied again that cccasioiai-
ly she heard from bin when he was on a trip to iiexico. LIK NG/2 asked
waet L/4 thought of aim (the Greek), to #nich she replied that she fcund
him pleasant and very generous ( bonéaéoso). L/2 replied, "Yes, but woat
does thet generosity come from?" He thea added that he had ‘many questicn- |
merks concerning that person. He gave as an exazple the fact that shen he
telephoned his numter on a holidey, 31 December or 1 cacuary, his "secre-
tary" replied. It seemed very strange, continued L/2, that 'the Greek's
telephone was manned et all times, night and dey, and even jon holidays.

. He then further expressed doubts about where this person lived and how

- he earned ois noney, anc why be was so interested in Cuda.

3- LIgIiG/4 stated to Rowton that she was st first quite taken aback by
this direct "interrogation", even thouch it was nace in a friendly tone,
and replied as ‘best she could by ear. Sne stated that she fens the

Greek was carryirg on lucrative business and lived in Zurope alobough she
could not supply any specific answers. She was aware that he had brought
some of LIXING/3's paintings at an exceilent price and took hisgenerosity
fpr granted since she enjoyed living froa the good businesd LIRING/3 cained
through bim. LILiG/4 then asked L/2 why he himself seietlas some checking

activity when che occasion aalleé for it. LIni!S/2 rezlied jthat he had
too meny other things to do, anc anyway, when scoething sndlled bad
("apesta") he-keeps away from it. LIsILG/4, continuing to'taze the of-
fensive, stated that on several occesicns inthe past the Greex hed invited
her out but sce had not accepted, Sut that ste easily could accept cn the
next occasion. azd pcssibly even obtain a rhnoto of sone. kaa for 21xEhG/2.
L/2 replied thet a paoto would not de of any use, all he coulé Go with
it being to send it to Havana. He acded that he uid many suspicions,parti-
culerly as a result of the telechcne, but hac nething concrete "in his

hands", and that what be needed was "datos". 1

4, LisliG/2 then asked 1/4 whether she knew when Xodolfo Reyes wes return-
ing end where he would be living? she told aowton that she replied in the
negative, commenting simply that she had hes&d that he. would be coving

to Chile to work in the nations] ballet there. 1/2 returning again to the
Greex wondered why he was so generous with gifts end entertainment. L/4”
stated that she never looxec a gift herse in the south, to which LixING/2
replied that she aust be careful, if not for her own sake at least for the
sake of LIXI:G/3 who, ‘he felt, was not treading on firm ground( “terreno
firme"). L/4 adnitted that she was often worried about L/3's activities,
about wrich he told her alnost nothing. L/2 then commented "Invesitisate
the Greek and you'il feel better." (Averizua lo del Griego). He then added
that taat supposed letter from Rico Gal4n was not considered authextic,
and also the case of Orozco definitely involved the police. Li S
she was awars thst 1/3 hed discussed both these cases with L/2, except
that L/3 had not to ter knowledge zentioned the arrest of Crozcc, stated

3/2,since

that she felt L/3 had acted in ccxzpletely good faith, ¢ even though te might ;

tacts. me commented that he could not even go out on a date with a girl

Sudject: Briefiing in Commusications end Security of LIRILNG/4.

id

1. During the cast four cays Rowton has had daily meetings with LIRING/S
to-give her initial training in 5/a and discuss cbenzels of, comusunicaticn
that micht te used securely and lorically by LIM: 6/4 and xowton. A"¢on-
tract" to serve as & letter of understencing for both xowton end LIRl.c/s
was Grefted es a basis for present and fuvure colatoration. No reference

0 NCFACT was sade or icplied, but xc.:ton nade it clear that he had "firexd:
and colleagues” who were interested in intellicence coverage of FSH

and woo would carry on his collaboration with 21#zii'G/S in the event of
kowton's death or unavailability.

2. The first item discussed was a simnle oven enda to Aactenstea nananne
of interest eitnoer as targets or possible hestile elezents, so that L/4°
cculd sention these perscns in the text of her 3/i correspondence witzosct
comprozising Lerself. 4 list of the persons concerned vith Eke code nezes
is attached terewith. Lek G/4 understands thet these cede names will rst
be used in o;en letters to LIXING/3 under any circocstances.

3. As far as letter drors are concerned, Kowten instructed LIR-1G/4 to
send her S/i nesscges with innocent text cover to the following address:
: Lic. Antonio Ponce Cortés

Kultifaniliar Miguel Alenén 0-326
México 12, D.F.

using a ncticcel return address thet could not be eas ily sraced, and crez—
ping the letter in a public mailbox in the center of town. xXowton dia not
‘give Lisi:G/4 an indicator for the cover text since it was understood tiat
all ressazes, except the’ first, would ccntain an S/w zessage. LIAiNG/4 pro
mised to aail an innocent text letter as scon efter arrival as possible so
that Rewt.n would have a g- od idea of the lenta of tine anvdaived in his
receiving future letters.

4 LIRiNC/4& was advised that she would receive S/J messages from xowton

on, the paper backing of Seriographic designs ( aztee seals) being produced
by LisiiG/3. The designs, prepared in the fcrm of greating ards, would :
be auéressed to a thiré perty and contain a brief nesssze of greeting in

* the hanéwriting of LIRIi:G/3 and woule be sent as an attachment to a rou-

tine letter from LIKING/3 sent by hand or throusch the ifRING pouch. Both
LIali.G/4 snd acwton agreed that open mail, since it would have to bear her
true name. and a-dress, would be both too risky and too jslow. In the un-
likely event of di:covery,l/4 would have some say out, priecing that she

5. At subsequent neevings however, LIRING/S accepted the probatle long

volded in sending et least sozec’ the messcges under cover of coral
corresponience ts LIRIiG/3. She also agreed with Rowton that’ serding
S/w on the back sf sericgrephic designs would ecnstitute a pattern and
might eftract urige attention. ;

6. It was theref:re apreed that LIz...G/4 would also write S/w iz letters

to LIRING/3 thst would be aand-carried to Hexico oy a 2riend or seat in

the pouch and Gelivered by Jorrin to ner Tacudcya address. iiowten structed
LIRIVG/4 to insert"Colonia Condesa” in the aéiress on tue enveloze if

the letter contained 3/w, ctherwise leave out this addition. Since Zodton
would have a key te the Caizada Tecusaya apartzent ne could cheek regularly
for any letters that Jorrin i.at 2ruve slipped under the door curiag periods
when LInInG/3 miznt be absent from Mexico City.

to take the ris in-

?. At his meetine with LIRILG/4 on 14/2/68 the following acditicnal signals
were agreed on:

(a) Danzer Signal : Cmisicn of name Zirzuni from open text. The
child woule alway eferred to in regular
correspondence with if G/3 by name. Ia e¥ent
of hostile control, iI fe would refer to
child as "hijita" or by sore cther endearing
name, but refrain from using ter :irst name.

(>) New carGon lieeded: te be indicated by the Shrase "I need
more vitacin B-12" or "I have run out of ny
: B12 cozplex vitamins".
’ (ce) Hew Developer Needed: " I have ren out of tiat nice cologne
I brought with ne".

‘
8. As far as incering S/# was concernéd, dowtor stated that if a cover
letter from Lisi-S/3 contained the words "Chiapas" and“arte" it would in-
dicate that an 5/* message was being forwarded in that letter.

v &. LIEING-3: Frou recent activity it sspears -
{ that the Guatemalan FAR may have rersved ita interest
t an LIRING-3. In late January, an emissary of FAR

representatives in the PORUMEN Capital traveied te
Mexico and contacted the person who had carried to
PBRUMEN the letter sent by LIRING-3 in the suamer .
of 1867 denouncing Moises CROZCO Leal. The emissary ~
brought the word that the FAR had much appreciated
LIRISG-3's letter om OBCZCO and warmed that the FAR -
. organization in Mexico City was infiltrated by a
VOFIRM operator. Try as he might, however, LIRING-3
failed, at least by the end of this pericd, to.
meet with tho FAR men.

byect: SGSslzL Zxanination of LIZING/3.

1. Prom about 1330 until 1530 on 29 September,1°0¢7, LIRING/3 iwas

given an SGSIRL exazination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse ( Tacu-
baya) with the SGosIRL operator at 0930 that corning and remained with
the operator until tae exazination was coupleted. Ne had not given LI-
RING/3 any previous notice of the nature or extent of the exanination,
but sinply asked hin,on 27 September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septen-
ber free for a lerzthy dicussion with gowton. Zowton introduced the SG-
SdI2L operator as selor Albertini, ea trusted "sccio", and spent the first
hour or so reviewing his relationship with LIzIG/3, ostensibly for the
veucias vl alvertici. Rowton thon, intrrartire the anhiect of certain
doubts that he hab in the past concerning iIR=:3/3's reporting, stated
that Albertini had <¢ means of checking scientis&fically the truthfulness
of LIBING/3's statenents. Howton explained that he was particularly con-
cernéd about the possiblity of LIRING/3 having doubled back with L=elic
andzaintaining with them a secret agreement of sone sort to report on .
Rowton and his activities.

2. LIRIKG/3 whet into a state cf visible shock at this and stated that
even the thought of betraying Rowtcn had never cccurred to hin at any time.
Yhen she SGSsI2L cperator explained the scientiZic means he was to use on
LIBimG/3, the latter stated that he could not pcssibly ‘accept this bonili-
ating means of testing him since it was diazentrically opposed to ais
principles. He pointed out that he had accepted Sowton at his word and he
could mt see or uccerstanc why Rowton could not do the ‘game for hiz, adding :
that the whole thing smacked of methods used by «CFACT and LIRING. He added .
j that if this meant that he would have to break with Rowton, then regret~ .
fully he would have to accept this alternative. de explained that submit-

i ing to the SGSsIRL examinetion would inevitably destroy the idealistic and
on profound relationship which he had previously felt he enjoyed with Rowton.

3. Rowton and the SGSaIRL operator spent the next two hours , ‘calming LIRING/: -
down and finally convincing hin ‘that he would not be compromising with his _
deeply-felt prizciples by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques—
tioned on his lovalty to Rowton and insisted thet he be asked, “"Do you be-
lieve in Rowton?" . : : | oan

appeared to be in reasonably sood spirits after the test, although
he was obviously emzotionally strained by the experience. Rowton made
a date to see him asain that evening at 21CO0 to talk things over in
a claner atmosphere. - - . : :

5. + that meeting with LIEING/3 Rowton explained that he had felt it
necessary to ascertain as ovjectively as pcusiblp the extent of LIZIS/3's
loyalty to bim and he was happy to have scientific proof that LIRING/3
had not berayed nix to the LIRING's. LIHHiG/3 stated that after it was
all over he felt Vetter and adnitted that he agreed with Rowton on the ;
necessity for such an examination, huniliating as it nisht at first beve

Be sonfecced thet ony ferrone" (fobntantions ona nomi gation’)

arredmed +r he
that he had nade in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce

_ for Rowton, since he still felt very sensitive about having to accept money
from Xowton without being able to render commensurate services. He stress-
ed, however, that et no time had he ever been disloyal to Rowton or done
anything against Howton's interest, as sefor Albertini could prove with
the results of the SGSHIRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Row-
ton's direction scrupulously and assured Kowton that he no longer feit.
unde> any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Ro«ton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGSWIRL examination disacy, sohn—
ting in its limited coverage, but it miust be reaiized that LIRING/3's,
initial reaction seas entirely negative and at one point he theatenea to.
break off completely with Rowton because of the insult to his “dignity”.
Although the SGS¥IRL operator felt that from a professional standpoint it
would be better to administer the exazination at another time when LIEING/3-
was less enotionally upset, Howton asked both him and LIRING/3 to go thru
with it on the spot, feeling that psycnolosically it was' essential to

make LIZING/3 sub=it, even for a limited test. Rowt:n also feels that the

. test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over LIRING/3 in the future,
when a second one can be more painlessly adainistered, ia a calmer atzos—
phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether :
LIRING/3 had been an LIRING double agent or betrayed Rowton in any way. i

2. Please note that ths 2GS¥IEL interviewer has made the
point that the principal misfortune in this’ interview probably
was that LIEING/3 was not tested on the fabrication of contacts
with the IDEM D's, which was thought to be the most probable
area of deceptian. :

3. In view of LIRIHG/3's threat to quit working for
ROWTON, we would be interested in hearing of any repurcussions
or change in attitude thet may have resulted from LIRING/3‘'s
having taken the test. We also are interested in the Station's
comments and recommendations as to the continued use of LIRING-3,
bearing in mind ROWION's recent report or LiAkthG suspicions ‘that

MEXICO CITY 3351

1. Forwarded attached are three reports dated 23, 28 and 30
October written by Wallace B. RO#TON on his contacts with Rodolfo

NA on 27 October, passing
himself as a wealthy Greek client of LIRING-3 who had called at
the latter's house to pay for a painting he had ordeted but had
been invited by LIRING-4 to come to the party. As previously agree
with the Station, RCWTON directed his main attention to REYES.’ .
The latter has resided in Havana since 1960 when he founded the
Cuban Ballet Folklorico. Until recently REYES has received the
monthly salary of one thousand pesos from the Cuban governnent,
and, according to LIRING~3 is well acquainted with political and
government personalities in Cuba. As pointed out in Reference,
ROWTON found REYES to be apolitical, a superficial sympathizer of

- the Cuban revolution and a great admirer of American choreography
(he told ROWTON he would very much like to go to New York to see
some of the shows there.) REYES complained about the relatively
low salary he is currently receiving from the Mexico City Belles
Artes for organizing a Cuban Ballet Folklorico show to be held
in Mexico City next December. He readily agreed to ROWTON's offer

to be his patron (to “help him out financially") if this could be dohe
on a very discreet basis. He said he hoped to put on another Cuban
show in Chile, before returning to his family in Havana: LIFEAT
coverage of LIRING-3's apartment for 26 October showed, .incident-
ally, that REYES maintains close enough relations with Silvia

DERAN (of Lee Harvey OSWALD fame) to be invited by her to hey

house for lunch. i |

2. Carsen MOLINA de CARRASCO is the leftist wife'of a
prominent local neurosurgeon, Juan CARPASCO with whom she spent
some yeas in Cuba. Eoth are Mexican citizens. According to what
she previously told LIRING-3, Carmen MOLINA helped gather some of:
the information used to defend both Victor RICO-Galan and the
ROSENBERGS. With the help of Alicia ECHEVERRIA ard the' latter's
uncle (who is the current Mexican Minister of Interior) Carmen
obtained a prominent position on the Mexican Olympic Committee
in the publication department. She is a close friend of Carmen
LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAMIREZ, a
Yabid pro-CASTRO Mexican chemical engineer who is still in Cuba.
Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted Mexican |
physician is married to a pro-CASTRO Cuban. According to informa-
tion made available to LIFTER-1, in early 1967 both he (armenegildo
and his second and present wife are bard core Marxists .'
wile, ura marla viciuita ue ia CALS, a Covau, Diali acce to
LIFTER-1, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including
the CASTRO brothers. Husband and wife naintain a close relation-
ship with the local Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ-Armas.
Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard line Marxist.
Information dated 1961 from RNLABILE indicates that she was |
active in Communist organizational work at UNAM and participated
in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian President
PRADO. Although ske is stitl clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be
quite as red now. She told ROWTON, for example, that she felt
nothing but disgust for her fanaticaily pro-CASTRO husband and
had strong resentment toward her step-mother. Per LIENVOY, July
1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PROENZA when the latter
was at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. : van

i

3. At a private iunch with Carmen HOLINA, 28 Cctcber,
ROWTON explained that he was a Greek leftist (although ‘not 2 KKE
nember) involved in lucrative international business. He said
that because of the current situation in Greece, it was difficult
for him to operate in Mexico as openly as he would like. He
could thus use MOLINA's help in obtaining certain types of
information and making discreet contacts with Mexican government
and business circles. MOLINA agreed to do what she could. She
stated that she was not a member of any Mexican or any; :other.
Communist organization, but merely a leftist sympathizer . She
also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with
the Cuban Embassy. LIONION-1, to whom a photograph of, MOLINA,
REYES and LOZADA (copy of which is forwarded attached) |was shown
Stated he had never seen these three persons enter the; Cuban -

e. To attempt operational development of Carmen

the hope that we can play on her “disgust” for the
fanaticism of her husband and her dislike of her mother- wee

LIRING-3 may be working for WOFIRM (or for the CASTRO government. )

party at the home of Carmen Molina de LEETERG8 2S 2k ¢ Amgterdan 252/6.
The only other persons at the party vesides ss be? Sse! ant org ausht ter of
Carmen Molina were Carzen Lozeda and Srricue Canuias, the, latter two of
whom had returned fro= Havana sone 30 days previously. All the adove
are Hexicans who have spent several yeurs in Havera end are social ac-
quaintances of LIKIHG/3 and LIaIkG/4. :

2. KCeTCK crashed the party in the company of LIRISS/4 according to «
previously agreed plan. LIRING/3 arrived at about 2030 alone, explaicing
thet ne md had to leave iIzIiG/4 at nome to wait for an important client
whe wes roving 2 payecue vss one OF iixiG/3's painticgs thet he had re-
cently purchased. LIgIht/3 was to add taat LIRING/s would ‘try to persuade
tris client to accozpany ner to the party so that te could meet everyone,

“and have a drink. L1iIhG/3 told xowton he was certeis that Carnen Kolina

would heve no hesitation in invitiag gowton to stay once he got into the
apartzent. :

3. Rowton and ‘LIRGNG/4 arrived about 2130 and fo.nd the party in full
swing with LI2iNG/3 and Sduardo Canudas struzllins to eet the pienoszmaph
operating ( they eventually borrowed another and played several: ¢ Cuban
revolutionary records.}. Rowton was introduced as Sr. Sarris,s Gresz .
Dusinessman ard long-standing client, and felt at tae end he was able’

to convince all sreseat that he actually was not from wCLADY (althcush
most apparentiy had that ixpression at the outset). Eowtonimanaged to toss
out a few phrases of Kussian at the right time in the direction of Carmen -
Kolina to izpress her ( fortunat@ly ber Russian is weaker even than Zouton'?
Kowton spoke some nglish with as good an accent as he could manaze. Carmen
Molina volunteered to hin privately that she had a great many “progressive®
friends in the U.S. Rowton was able to insert severzl comments about the

{ -
current political situation in Greece that was forcing him into a virtually
“clandestine exiestence in Hexico, as well as elsewhere. averyone appeared

to sympathize wits Rowtcn and ceased asking any personal questions.

expleined in quite sericus tones that he was engazed in the trainicsg oz
a Kexican ballet srcup under the auspices of Bellas artes to present a
perforsence of the Folklorico Cubano in the near future. He added tuat
he had been the founder of the Folklorico Cubano in tre early, 60's in
Havana and had a wife ( ballerina} and young daughter in, Havana whoa he
was anxious to return to.

5. Since noston felt taat nodclfo was at the aocent the dest target for
assesszent he invited hia to join him in visiting the Sefiorial nigst—-ciud
to see the Greek dances put on by 4 group of Greex sxusicians. xoéclfo
accepted eegerly and they both left the party et about C030. Rovstcn had
perviously ctteired the office telephone of Carmen Helina ( 34-60-32, ezt

in a few private comments ( i.e. ccnp)isents) to Carmen Lozada so tuat. ae
could follow up at a later date if this was considered desirable. Ze found
Carsen Lozada in excellent spirits and et tines definitely provocative,

“had- begun divorce prodeedings). : 1;

Rodolfo keyes to them and speak enough Greek to convince, Reyes that he.
knew them well eri was himself a Grrek. The musicians, who probaodly 23~
sumed Xowton was a Greek-americen, did not speak enough Spanish to taik
directly to kodolfo. They invited zowton and Rodolfo to return on 31 Cet
when they expected fever people in the audience and when! they could show
oe Rodolfo some of the Rost popular Greek cances.

late supper ( no food was served at the Carmen Kolina party) and he was
so + able to continue his conversation with hin there. Rodolfo revealed that

He took this opening to offer to help Rodolfo financially from‘tine to tine,

8. Rodolfo Reyes is ebviously dedicated to his art and appeared to Seuton
to be a seriozsminded ger choreographer. He showed a certain effesinite
manner in his gestures and remarxs ( speaking only in spanish } character-

Subject: Report of LIKING/3 Suspect Affiliaticr with WO?Tan.
1. LIRING/2 reported to “owton at C900 on 30 coteven, 19671 that he
had finally senged to have a private talk with Rodolfo! Reyes Cortes,
bis Mexicen chereograpner friend, ou the afternoon of 27 Gctover 19673
and that, ir the course of conversation, Zodolfo xeyes' had revealed
to LIKING/3 in confidence tuat the reason why the LI2iNGS had assumed
a rather cool attitude toward LIXING/3 over the past year. 2odolfo
Reyes explaized that the last time he was in “avana he md heard rumors,
arong bis friends in the Mexican colony, that LIXIiG/3 was working
“either for «(rIzM or the Cubans". Rodolfo went on to say that the
origin of tars rumor, as lar as he could ascertain, was the fact that
LIRING/3 had nade two trips into Havana for no known specificreason and
at his own expense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that ae himself did not
: believe the rumors or, at least, did not care whether they were true or
not, commented to LIRING/3 that other menbers of LIZING/3's profession
were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and were
always quick to draw their own conclusions.

2. LIRINS/3 cocmented to Rowton that, although this news had shaken hi”
and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared ‘particularly whet |
i . the LIRIKGs thousht of them, since their own conscience was elear.. II-

RiNG/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop: bis
cozmercial ectivity in Chiapas ( especially since acdolfo Reyes' home is
by coinciderce located in San Cristébal) so that word ‘would gradually.
__ filter back to the Lislics that he actually did have financial resources
outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that obviously the LIRINGs
did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all
“> gontact with him as well as LIRING/4, He concluded that since the LIRIsGs
_ had certain suspicions, they navurally warned all his \friends and former

an . with him until their doubts could be resolved.

a “3. In reply to Rowton's query LIRING/3 stated that sate Reyes and Carmen
Molina (separately) had commented to him that they sere favorably inpresseu
by Rowton ard dic not voice any suspicion of Rowton's ‘bona fides (as a
Greek leftist businessuan). Carmen Mobina, in fact, hdd gone so far as to

sbow some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to Rowton pre-
viously since she was anxious to develop sone sort of lucrative business

4, LIRLiG/3 continued that he had been maintaining discreet ‘personal

in Coyacah, had remarried tand that her step-notner was a Cuban sicentist
uc Led dived wauy year:: 1n Mexico. She added that both her father and
step-nother were on excellent social terns with Ambassador Herrdnéez Armas.
' She revealed that she oad already notified her husband, Mnrique Ramirez,
tk:-t she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storm of protest both:
froz him ( in Havana) and her father and step-mother, both of whoa were
“puritanic” despite their "progressive" convictions. She added that she
expected Znrique Ramirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received
her letter and to appeal to her fzther and step-zother to save his mar- '
riage. She, however, insisted to LIKIiG/3 that she had nade up her mihd
that she woulce go through with the divorce. She added taat for this reason
she dia uot wish to live with her father and had decided to stay with.
her friend, Carmen Molina, until the divppce papers were through and ‘the
storm had blown over. She added that she did not particularly like being

a house-guest in the smali aprtment of Carmen *olinc, bat at the soment
- she had no choice. H . :
