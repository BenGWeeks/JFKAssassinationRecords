ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter IL, CSHB 70-1-1; 27 October 19668

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those catesories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and ~
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2 THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are: .

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual

b. The 201 Dossier: thé official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
* 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individnal, i.e. pec-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. *

©. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 20] reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

@. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated. : .

15 November 1974

ec. OF Code: a two letter symbal used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two c.tegories of OL
codes for use Ly components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or 2 code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. .

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
cwployces, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of Jocal interest to a field station or Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO |
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categorics of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2 201
dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

tional interest for training purposes only. .

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out t and submitting : :

a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main- . ‘
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the i i
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign- :
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample Bh t !
a 201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20I's. A field j i .: |
a station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head- : ; !
oe quasters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the i seg
ean : subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening £ : :
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by tq i
e placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN fi :

: - will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

15 November 1974

All standard listings are cumu!stive; previous editions must be destroyed
upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely
sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Stondard Listings
Based on one or more of the following selection criteria: _
’ (1) Country of location oe
(2) OL codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation) ;
(3) Citizenship bes ;
(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)
(5) Occupation. ose - oo .

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,
a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the
Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be
produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915
and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the
United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an
OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OF code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also
that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific
as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation cede for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some ‘occupation codes cover more than one ©

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice
some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics
* and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category

“++ will be included in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted
_ (arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords: _

(a) Sumame
(b) Given name

(d) Country of birth
(e) Citizenship

“Sorts can be made within sorts. For example, 20t personalities may be sorted
alphabetically by sumame within OI codes for given countries of location.
Because two O] codes may be listed for each personality, those names with two
OI codes would be listed twice.

ce. Scheduled Listings

Standard and non-standard listings printed semiannually.
d. Special Listings ;

Unscheduled, usually non-standard, listings produced on a one time basis
an response to special operational requirements.

e. Request for Listings

All requests for standard or non-standard alphabetical and numerical 201

listings for Headquarters and the field, for changes in periodic listings, and for

. information on the 201 machine list system should be made to the component
