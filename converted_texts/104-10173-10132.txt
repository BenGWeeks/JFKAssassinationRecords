determined that $33,500 was advanced. to hin.
for-travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for. he and.his family to renew their
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully
. accounted for.._However, in his accounting,
one item appeared unusual. It was an °
expenditure of $1,600. for a-sensitive | .
opération which was approved for write-off -by Mr. ©
Joc... . Desmond’ Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without 7
Te, further ‘accounting. . ne

3. Also, we confirmed. that no other Agency advance accounts

were established for Mr. Hunt during this. period.

: 4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The
EUR Division accordingly, requested we’ open an account at ‘the
Chase, Manhattan’ Bank in Mr. Hunt's name. to receive all non- —
-salary payments (Mr. Hunt “had an“account at Riggs National -
Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The -

following: deposits were made to the account during 1965S. and~

further searching would be-sonewhat’fruitless.. One strange © i
aspect of the non-official cover assighment in Madrid is that i
: all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the :

Feported activities involving Mrs. | Hunt. 2 eee

- Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964

(by which he fixed:the time), and took over the Iberian desk, Bill
Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the. time). In early autumn’
“Ryan said that he had just been-informed by the DDP (Karamessines)
that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-

“ment. by Helms, A memo was prepared and sent to. the COS, Jim Noel
- (now retired).: There.was.nothing further for about a month when Ryan’
called Coleman in and. showed hin a RYBAT letter from Noel stating.
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the

Embassy.

3. Woodward-had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt
was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting
the days until Hunt left.:: The President of Uruguay ‘visited President.
Eisenhower in the;States, at which time he requested a personal favor--_ -
that Hunt be ‘reassigned to Montevideo, - So Hunt took another tour. ,
Woodward was outraged, and had his revengé ‘in n 1964 when. Hunt was -

te be sent.as DCOS to Madrid.

2 emg ee nel ue

4. After a couple of month’- early 1965--Ryan célied ‘Coléman
in and, observing that ‘there was more than one way to.skin a cat,
told him that Hunt was going to Spain: under nonofficial cover... This |
didn't require anything special, Ryan saying’ that he, didn't. know , -
= much about it.” It came to,him from Karamessines.on Helms! order, ;
‘. Hunt was to have the telephone: number of the COS, but he would do.

nothing for the station. Hunt was 'to submit administrative’ vouchers’ :
_ , for, reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman 7 f
“<gaid- he never saw Hunt before he went out. -He knows that there was
no operatiorial reporting, to indicate that Hunt was doing. anything. .

The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was. poor,

Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing | off, and

Ryan waid he could talk-to Karamessines- i€ he Wished, “Because “~~

Coleman.had a-close personal. association with Karamessines he:

did just’ that, He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much:

that Coleman. need not worry because he was gone. beget ok

Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked
about Hunt, Woodward said it might still be dragged into the. press.
Tad Szule had been after Woodward-about the Hunt assignment to
Spain. Coleman observed that Szule did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,

with Me. Hunt while at the Mullen Company on a contiauing

. basis, because Mr. O'Malley was interested in Nr. Puat

~-—-->-~ for possible referwal of other‘Ayency retirees. Nr.
O'Malley also understood that there was Cover and. Coa-

Nr. Hunt: became instrumental in discussing several aspects
of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of
the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance: when these -indi-

requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with’
specific qualifications. These instances occurred apparent-
ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with
the White House. In one instance Mr. Hunt requested re-
ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary. As in
previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Mailey was unable
to. recall the name of this. individual. He. did, -however, -
state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the:
individual whom he referred: .As a point of clarification,
Nv. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously
been known to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked —
for him in any capacity. Mr. O'Malley. also recalled a ..
request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skilis in

then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,

‘At this point. Mr. O'Malley was asked whether or not fron

his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt. Nr. Hunt was in
the habit of making glib comnents which were not neces-

-in coordinating funding for the covert action activities
.Of Mr. E. Howard Huat, the issue was raised as to whether
Or not the funding of Mr. Hunt's projects continued beiveen
July 1965 awd September 1964 while Nr. Haat was a contract
cnaployee stationed at Madrid, Spain. Nr. O'Malley recalled
that at the tine of Mr. Hunt's signment.to Madrid the
statement disseminated for. consumption within the Ageacy
was that Mr. Hunt was retiring. Mr. O'Malley stated that.”
this was not génerally believed. Mr. O'Malley was quite:
certain that duzing this period his office handled no’
project funding for Mr. Iiint. In response to specific |
question Mr. O'Malley stated that on Nr. Hunt's return to

staff employment. the projects and funding which stopped in

‘A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations. .
: The purpose of tha interview was to follow up on infor-

mation contained in Office of Security files which stated

_ the belief that individuals in the Counter Intelligence

of Nr, E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record”
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now retired, and | Mr. Edward

“ 2, During ‘this interview Mr. Roces was specifically | :
-. askad whether or not he had knowledge of the existence of Coote
“any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr. a :
- E. Howard Hunt ‘to writo novels to improve the image of

that in all probability an official acquiescence on the. . 4 ,
part of senior officials might have been involved rather . i. i

Mr. Hunt was undsr any form of Agency: sponsorship in his
writing of the David St. John novels. Nr. Pfortzheimer replied
that he was never officially briefed on the matter and that
-orily Mr. Helms. or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
MY. Pforzheimer was then asked if either Mr. Angleton or Mr.

4. Mr. P£orzheimer went. on to relate that he was
Qceasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled

subsequent novel Tower of Silence which appeared under the
St, John pen name in Nr. Pforzheimer parenthetically
pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of .
Mr. Hunt's two sons--David and St. John. .

cr OS Tracing Mr. Hunt's career as$ignnents, it is noted
that’ he was assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director

2. “Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear °
on the matter, and that he was "reaching, "but stated that has he
. reconstructs the matter: . :

Sm ar. He became aware that Hunt, while in Wu, was ; accomplishing : "
a “steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-
. quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated"
that this activity continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and -
| agreed with idea that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate =
ot that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised
* "+" that he raised the issue “up front” on severa! occasions.
he recieved to his raising the issue was that "Keop your stinking nose out

the issue, Ray Rocca and Walter Pioraheimer, both of whom were involved,

in the "image" materials. He stated that Pi forzheimér seemed to be aware

of all the details. = on an up to date basis - of Huat's departure from the,

Agency to join the public relations firm, to the degree that Gen. Gaynor

a, . gained the belief that Hunt was merely moving his desk outside the building,

7 but being paid by the same source as before. He also advised that he kept
Miss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hunt's

- activities because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her ‘ a .
recall about what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be~- : —
-better than his at this date. (He also mentioned an incident in w hich Morse

Hunt--who might have some recall or have picked up information about

the book-writing matter might be Anita Potocki of CI Staff, formerly of

of her dislike for Hunt, she made it somewhat her business to follow his
