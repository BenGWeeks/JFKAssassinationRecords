ANNEX B
‘THE 201 SYSTEM:

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I; 27 October 1966
1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for -
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to. those categories. Only a rela-

" tively’ small number of personalities: indexed are of sufficient interest to justify po
“opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and...)
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi- — - :
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a Volume’ of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM .

The principal features of the 201. system are: .

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as’ identifying file number for reporting on that
individual.

b. The 201 Dessier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i-e., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. :

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved’ for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference:. this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. Wien data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref- ue
erence ‘consolidated. :

e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record: the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as‘well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OF
codes for use. by components; . .. cee

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)
(2) OF cedes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two 501 codes. An ot code may be assigned ,

“when ‘the 201 Personality. File Action Request ‘(Form 831) is initiated (see.
paragraph 3b below) by filling i in Box 13 or a code may be assigned | or added .
“ata later date by a Form 831 amendment. . :

The 201 system has ‘the capability ‘of producing machine listings. of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

f. 201 Mazhine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on -
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER.
a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened <n ,
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and-ger- :
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those *~
persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals
are yequested (see exception below), 201 files are nut to be opened on staft ©
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

cee ments.on ISG for automatic 201 openings oni certain categories of persons whose »
; . Rhames appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are listed in Attachment 2. 201.
" dossiers should be ‘opened in the following categories: : :

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval: requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

7 tonal interest for training purposes only. - ..- - ee,

é - tt (2)- Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening,

ee ~~ (3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats. of ‘other ian ;
: ., denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel. as _

_f 4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire, Part I.

_ : ~ (8) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five “
: or more documents (see DOI 70-20). .

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS). .

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and 1 submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
’ 201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after’ the
subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 20] opening *
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201. after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Fisld stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record. :

a "Purging

_ Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It. requires
. discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the.
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, ie. exact copy(s) of a document.

- (2) Name trace form (Form 62) unless 3 it has been the basts for
the opening. ee : :

J 703) Att abstract slips.
oe . (4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

. (B) The disseminated version of: positive satelligence information a
. acopy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch .
_.. cover sheets unless there-are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier’
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
-officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained
in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a

cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the Jocation :
of the TS document. .

(9) Deferred documents (see 5b(2)).
