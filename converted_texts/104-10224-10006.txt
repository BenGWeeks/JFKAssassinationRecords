MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Jeass W. MeCord, Jr. a
THROUGH 2 Head of gg Career Service .
" SUBJECT = Notification of Non-cligibility for Designation as a

Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1, As you may know, we are in the Process of reviewing the e=ployment
history and current career field of all employees in the agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a‘participant in the new CIA.
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial Teview of
€ach case is.made “by ‘the individual's Career Service, If the Head of his
Career Service nominates nim for Participation in the System, this -aomina-.
tion is reviewed by: the CIA Retirement Board which recor nds final action
te me. However, if the Head. of the.Carcer Service adv: “that che employee

C © requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, ¥ have -

do€S not meet ‘the |

- accepted thi€. finding without further review by the CIA Retirement. Board.

This practice ‘has been adopted: in the interest of expediting this..screening

“process so that those employees who are eligible to Participate in the sys-

tem may be designated Participants.as soon as possible,

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised m that
yuu do not meet the requirements of WR ‘20-50 for designation as a partici-

pant. and [ have accordingly made ‘the formal determination required by the

regulation that you are Not..eligible for designation, From.a review of your

record it appears that. the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you do not have sufficient time Prior to completing 15 years

of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months

of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you~

sre not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current. i
Status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude -recon-

' sideration of your eligibility to Participate in the CIA System if you should

meet. the requirements for ‘designation in the future,

3.” Should you desire further information concerning the requirements -

_for designation -as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, 1 suggest that

You read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
cated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees,"

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the_determination-— -

made_in_your_case--may have~been™ incomplete or inaccurate regarding votr actual
exzployment history with the. Agency, Tf, after studying the materials cited

ble to-participate im the CIA Retirement System, please ‘feel free to contact
officiais of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition,’ you may wish lo dis-
‘uss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 6£-1319 Read-
Guarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve ary questions

you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of

the date of this memorandum, ™ ae ~

MEMORANDUM For; Director of Security

SUBJECT : = McCORD, James Wi, Jr, ‘Emp, Ser. No, 58124
. Fitness Report Se :

1, This ia an annuat fitness report covering the period
1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970, Mr. McCord completed
his first full year as Chief, Phyaical Security Division, During
1969 the Division underwent many changes, 9 direct result of the
Personal efforts of this employee. He has shown the initiative
to seek out new ways and means to harden the security of our

- domestic and overseas facilities by tapping all possible tech-

nological sources both in and out of Government, His efforts
have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture
in the physical security field is far Superior to any of our con-
temporaries, . :

2. With the Spiraling costs of manpower, Mr, McCord
‘don the potential for use of technical devices to

has concentrate
emarkable inroads into

replace the human asse:, He has made ¢
this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive,

. 3. Mr. McCord has the quality w inspire his subordinates,
He is demanding, but understanding, On more than one occasion
he was &sked to take under his wing employees who were labeled
Through personal interest and effort, he has salvaged

"problems, "'
ere they are performing

the majority ofthese individuals toa point wh
ina highly Satisfactory manner. : :

- 4. In the previous fimess report, I alluded to the fact that
employee has a tendency to find it difficult to isee another Person's
Point of view, This, I feel, is attributable toian innate stubbornness

which obviously is difficult to overcome, ‘Mr: McCord is a very
. : : i . .



--- Page 94 ---
principled individual who once convinced he has hit upon the proper
course of action will usually yield only by direction, We've discussed
this, and I've noted a deternined effort on his part to broaden his

tolerance for other opinions.

5. Overall, the employee has sade a substantial contribution

SUBJECT ‘ “+ McCORD, James wW., Jr,, Emp. Ser. No, 058124
te Fitnéss Report : ’

1, This iw an annual fitness Teporl covering the period

1 April 1968 through 31 March 1969. During the firnt period of

this report, Mr. McCord served as the Chicf, Technical Division/
* PTOS and continued to display a very high degree of professionalism

in administering the Agency's world-wide Audio Countermeasures

{ACM) program, Under his guidance, several new devices and :

‘techniques were developed which have helped the Agency .and the

intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated

advances by the opposition-in the field of positive audio,

- 2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the
- activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides :
ACM inatruction to.all members of the community in the latest of
equipment and techniques,

3. On 14 October 1968, he waa reassigned to the position;
of Chief, Physical Security Division, Although he had relatively
little experience in this particular field, he has quickly assimilated | : :
the necessary details to manage this Agency effort. He has taken : .

an steps toward the development.and use of the most advanced physical. a ‘
7G security equipment and techniques to protect the Agency, Under i
the supervision of Mr, McCord, the Agency Security Command
: Center operations have been expanded and-improved. He has been
GY . assigned the reaponsibility to organize and direct the Security efforts
relating to the Protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations,
riots, and other civil disturbances, He coordinated the Agency
Security effort with the U. S. Secret Service in protection of the.
President of the-United States during his. recent visit to ‘the CIA

Headquarters,

eo:

4. Mr, McCord is considered to be economical in-his use
of equipment,- manpower and funds,

5. Perhaps one of the stronger attributes this employee
possesses ia his ability lo organize, Ina relatively short time,
he has deliberated the Physical Security Division's mission and
already taken steps to restructure it within existing manpower
limitationg to more effectively react to.its responsibilities.

6. He inspires hia subordinates and has the respect of his
superiors, There have been instances, however, when Mr, McCord
has exhibited a certain intolerance with individualsu who do not agree
with his point of view, resulting in some friction in thelr working
relations, There has been much improvement in this regard, and.
Ido not feel it will present any problem in the future.

7, Lanticipate this employee will continue to absorb knowe-
ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate
he has during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will

‘result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency, I rate

Mr. McCord a high "Strong."

Perhaps the most outstanding accomplishments which I attribute to Mr. McCord!s

equipment in the counteraudio field, I have a distinct impression thst he and his
Division are considerably ahead of other Government departments ia this area of
activity. This fact alone is a high tribute to his management skill, Because of the
success in this field, I consider him to be economical in the use of ™=éenpower and

During this rating period, the Technical Division has had operational

3. Corsments of Reviewing Official

I concur thoroughly with Mr, Winters! evaluation of Mr, McCord's
vigor and enthusiasm, skill and judgment. I would add to this that he
has dernonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising
the deveiopment of several new and valuable techniques in the counter~
Measures field, However, I would rate him only "Proficient" in
Specific Duty Number 6, for I believe that he has not been as effective
as he rnight be in liaison and coordination with other components of
the Intelligence Community represented on the Technical Committee, :
This is unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance
in all other elements of his assigned responsibilities, He must work
on improving these relationships and he has been counseled to this
effect by his current supervisor,

Naloon with British and other Western intelligence representativos
Involving nun:erous trips to Europe. Thie Haison activity with
represcotatives of tho British MI-5 eatabliehed » direct channel

of communications resulting in a continous exchange of leade and
a flow of uperational data over the years of benefit to the Agency.

During the period of hia work with the Security Research
Staff, in which he served as D-puty Chief from May 1957, Mgr,
McCord was the Agency's caao officer in a number of double agent
‘asco involving Agency etaff employees who had been contacted .
and were being developed for recrultniont by the Soviet intelligence

service,

From 1962 to 1964, Mr. McCord served overseas a5 Chief
of the Rogiona! Security Support Staff located at Frankfurt, Germany
with responsibility for tho overall personnel and physical security
and audio countermeasures programe applicable to the Stetlone and
Baoes of the European area. This assignment wae followed by
attendance at the Air War College, August 1964 to June 1965,

For the psat five years, Mr. MeCord has held two vital ‘ne
positions with world-wide reaponsibilities involving the Agency's

_ audio countermeasurena and physical security programe.

As Chiof of the Technical Divieion from 23 Juty 1965 to
19 Cetober 1968, Mr. McCord supervieod a technical operation
with considerable skill, Although not an engineer by training, he
spanned a difficult gap between the sdministrative aad tectnicsl!
demando of his reeponsibilities, guiding the devoltopment of useful
and esoteric equiprnent In the counter-audio field to & point where
the Agency becar.e the recognined leader among Goveramont depart-
Ments fe thio area of activity. This loaderehip is evidenced by the

irr-agination went into the creation of thie tretniog activity which . :
commenced operations about the time of his reaseignment to the

Physical Security Division.

Me, McCord participated with two subordinate employess
in the devolopment of x-ray equipwiont for use by the Technical
Division in detecting and locating hostile audio devices implanted
in office appurtenances and walle of Agoncy cecupied facilities.
The responsibility for Onouring that appropriate protective methods
for the safe use of thie equipment was also associated with thia
development. The significance of thia echieverrent wae recognised
by the Agoncy when Mr, McCord and hie participating colleagues
were awardod Certificates of Merit with Diatinetion in October 1966,

In his carrent position as Chief, Phyeteal Seeurity Divistea,
Mr. MeCord demonstrated his ability to quickly asoimilate the
hecessary detailo of a field (n which he had relatively little ex-
perience. H- showed initiative in eecking out new weys and moans
to harden ths security of the Agency's domestic and overseas
facilities by tapping all poesihlo technological rescurces, both in
and ont of Government, to produce for the Agency « posture In the

“ From eorly December 1965 through Mny.1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jy., Alan Fy Petit, nnd Willinnm . Marcy -of the Technical Division, Offic
of Security, conceived and developed a unique technique for the use of a

- small portable X-ray machine which has been pinced in extensive use in

“|. the Agency's’ Audio-Countermensuron Program. Experimontation during these
‘months indicated that X-ray combined with a fluorescopic screen had disti
‘advantnges in terms of time and effort over tho considorably more expon-
sive X-ray film and processor. Along with this, they designed an. innova-
tion in the form of n fluoroscopte cloth which hng the distinct advantnge
of flexibility over the fluorescent screons currently available on the
commorcial. market. . a Le :

...-The combination of the X-ray ond tho fluorescent cloth make it pos-
sible to rapidly scan in “real time" lorge wall surfaces and furnishings,
QO capability the Agency has not had before.

1 ‘The Tecknical Division ins greatly enhanced the world-wide use of
this equipmont in that they designed and developed a packaging plan whore

‘ by using two attache cases they are able to eastly transport the X-ray

fluoroscopic equipment, wall racks, and motor units making it possiblo to

inconspicuously carry it into offices, residences, and gafehouses.

These men have shown initiative, ingenuity and great imagination in
the application of fluoroscopic scanning with X-ray. .

This technique, much of which required many off-duty hours to develo

Reference is mado to the attached monorardun dated 1 November 1958, which is
the summary excerpted from tho report of the operation submitted on that date.

Upon receipt of information, 2 July 1958, that 4 momber of the-Soviet-Soreign Office
in Moscow had menticned to one of the American Embassy staff mombars that the Soviets
had knowledgs of the crew of the missing C-115, Kr. McCord was appointed hea: of a team
of men from Headquarters to proceed immediately to Germany to plan for and debrief the
crew of ‘the C-116 in-case they were released. Lo .

At Wiesbaden, acting upon polic, guidance received fron Headquartors, Mr. MeCord mad
detailed plans for the interrogation of crew members; Prepared news releases and made
Plans for tho handling. of the press; arranged for reunion of the crew members with their
families; and arranged medical éxaminationsa, al: with the view toward avoldin: publicity
or incidents which might reveal Central Intalligence Agency interest in the hichly

sensitive nature of the plane's flight. ween

when the crew arrived at Wiesbaden, Mr. McCord directed the over-all interrozations
and participated in portions of the interrovation o: the crew mambers himself. He pre-
pared cables and dispatches for Headquarters es well as the over-all report of tlie de-
briefing of the crew. He briefed the crew m-mbers regarding their conduct before the
press. He.also assisted in the plane for the return o: the crew members to Washington,
all of which entailed around-theeclock work.

Upon return to Washington, Mr. McCord directed the detailed debriefin: of the crew,
covering all aspects of possible compromise of security of CIA Personnel, operations, and
cover unit activities, as well as various positive intelligence and counter-intelligence
matters. Final reports wore prepared and Mr. MeCord participated in bricfings of the DCI,
DOCI, ani: various Air Force and Defense hepertment officials. so

The ingenuity, foresicht, planning and suidance exercised by Mr. McCord from the time
the team first left for Eurose, throu-h the initial debriefing, and then in following ~
throuh in the devriefinga hack at Headquarters, resulted in rapid and thorouh intere
view cS the crew members, assessment c> the ccmpromice to the Agency, and determination
of appropriate action needed by the Aroncy to counter such compromise. His performance
in that instance was of the highest derree and did mich credit to this Agency in the

highly professional manner in which it was performed.

‘ SUBJECT: | American C-118 Aireraft Downed in Soviet

\

‘Azerbaijan 27 June 1958 by Soviet MI0-17!s

On 27 Juns 1758, a C-118 cargo plane, assigned to the U.i8, Air ?
Force in Wiesbaden, was fired on and forced down near Oendarkh, Soviet
Azerbaijan, The plane was carrying nine U, S, airmen, three of whom
are assigned to thiz tzenmy, They are Colonel Dale D, Brannon, Major
Robert E. Crans and Major Bennie. A. Shupe. The other six men were
regular Air Force members assipned to Wiesbaden, Germany, The nine mon
were en route from Wiesbaden to Teheran and Pakistan on a flight carry~
ing cargo for CIA, Col. Brannon and Major Crans were Planning to get off
the plane in Teheran had tha Plane remained on course,

The plane, while en route to Teheran from Nicosia and as a result
of bad weather and nariyation error, went off its plotted course and
crossed into Boviet Armenia. There it was intercepted and fired on by
three MI0-17's and Caught fire in the left wing. Five of the crew bailed
out and the other four rode the aircraft down to a safe landing on a
small airstrip at’ Genfarth in Soviet Azerbaijan. The crew renters who
had remained on the plane to its landing got out safely and the plane
was burning fiercely when the crew last saw it. The part of the crey
that psrachuted was surrounded by Soviet Peasants, some of whom beat and

‘struck at the crew members, One of the men, Major Bennie Shupe, Cla

employee, was taken by the mob:to a telephone pole and narrowly escaped
hanging before being reacved by the. Soviet military, .

-- Major Shupe andthe remainder of the crew were turned over to the .
Soviet military, and efter an overnient stay in a Soviet military ,
Garrison near Stepanaxert were taken to a city believed to be Tevlakh,.. .
and then flown to Baku, Russia, There they underwent interrogation by
Soviet intelligence officers, at least one of whom had served in the

United States, as a Soviet ‘Purchasing Commission amployae 1943-45, and

later in Canada in 1949-55 as First Secretary of the Soviet. Enbassy,

This RIS officer, Vladimir Bourdine, later served in 1955 as a personal
interpreter for Rhrushchey in a meeting with Prime Mintoter Nehru of

India, Bourdine interrogated Colonel Brarnon of CLA at considereble

length during the period 30 dune - 3 duly 1958, while the crew was ine
Prisoned in the MVD Headquarters building in Baku. Following their
individual interrogationa, the crew nenbers were required to appesr
Separately before a Commission of Soviet. officials at‘the Baku MVD
Headquarters who questioned them about the bordor violation by the

C-108 aircraft, and Tequested them to sin statements attosting that

they had been vell-treated and recoived adequate medical care by the

the place of releaéo was loarncd: from tho Soviats to be Astara on the
Soviet-Iranian border, ani a USAFE plane waa ‘dispatched that hight from
Wiesbaden with the Air Maritimo team mombor aboard destined for

Teheran to await the turnover of the American fliers at Astara. The
fliers were turned over on 7 duly. 1958, were immediately flown to
Wiesbaden, Cermany where an initial joint CLA-AF debriefing of them
was beguh, and whore initial press interviews were held, following
careful brieting of the crew as to tho text and limitations to be
observed. Two days later, two mombers of the crew, one of whom was
Major Shupe, a CIA employee, wera permitted to give an interview to the
Paris represéntative of Time-Life. Members of the CIA team were pre-
sent during these press Inter ws, under appropriate cover -arrangemontg,

_ to furnish guidance to the CIA porgonnel,

Following the initial debriefing, the entire crew was flown to

‘Washington, D.C. on 18 July 1958, for a more extended debriefing,

These debriefings were completed on 5 August 1958 and covered the
various aspects of possible compromise of the socurity of CIA :
personnel, operational and covor units activities, as well as various
positive intalligonce and counter-intelligonce matters,

The threa CIA men aboard the plane were extremely lnowledgeable

peasants on lending and was later turned back to_hin by _the.Soviet——. -
Commisoion-menbers at Baku. Neither he nor other members of the crew

were questioned about either of the briefcases, their contenta, nor

about the address book and its contents. We assume that the Soviets

have or will process the naraa in the address book through their Moscow
files. Som of the other crew vembers carried personal notaticns in _ __.

“. their wallets relating to a few other CIA personnel,

We have received no: indications that Colonel Brannon or the other
crewmen were drigeed or otherwies tampered with by the Soviets, Brannon
and. some of the others did receive shots the first nicht and second day
from the Soviet military for their wounds and burns; however, these

shoto are believed to have teen for legitimate medical reasons,

The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniqueo of
interrogation has been exhaustively explored with all the crew members
in the course of. the detriefings, In summation, the interrogations
of the crew members were superficial and do not appear to have bsen
backed up -by- close coordination and communication with Moscow for
intelligence research purposes, It is poselble that tha quick ace

group and given preferred treatment, apparently with the intention of
developing them for Ainforration purposes. We are conviticed that both
men handled themselves extremely well and did not dis¢lose any infore
mation concerning the Agency or its activities,

To date we have no indication that the Soviets knew at the time
they interrogated the cred pen, that the flight of the C-118 was cone
nected with CIA in any; way, nor that they knew. three of the men aboard
were CIA personnel, We do believe that in time the Soviets, through
Brannon's address book, which lists the Open Agency telephone number
EX 3-6115 below his name on the first page, will connect him and
possibly others in the address took with CIA, Since the Soviets
questioned him atout the 7170th Support Group and the 7L05th Support,
Squadron in Wiesbeden, dt 19 therefore presumed that they will asso.
ctate those units with this Agency,

In addition to this report, debriafings| of the crewmen
were taped and typed, ‘which will total some 7,000 = 9,000 pageg

7 ~ orter that Agency interests will be adequately protected and proper
security will be miintained in the handling of information and reports
derived from.the debriefings, and s0 that no compromise of the Agency
Antorest in the flight of the C-118 will be made to the press,

CONCLUSIONS

A. It is our + opinton that the possible compromises arising out of
: this incident are relatively minor in nature and that no major

compromises occurred,

B. That the Soviets "missed" on the true nature of the flight and
personnel of the C-118,

C, That the reasons the crev members wore given an early release
were as follows: - .- ot t

1. Primarily, the Soviet interrogators failed to use all
of the leads at their commind, particularly Brannon's
address book, and failed to break the crewmen through

interrogation.

2. The crew did not inadvertently disclose through in-
terrogations, the purpose of their flight, its relation
to the Agency and that of three of its crew to ClA..

3. The Soviets apparently failed to check out the names
and other data in Brannon's address book through their
files prior to release of the crew.

4. No incriminating information or material was inmediately
recovered from the burned aircraft,

5. Several of the crew destroyed incriminating building
passes and notations in their wallets while on their
way down in their parachutes, or immediately after
landing in their chutes,

6, There were either no leaks or insufficient leaks of
incriminating information through any room conversa-
tions «t Baku among the crew, which may have been moni-
tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there
may have been were not properly interpreted, or inter-
preted soon enough to tip the Soviets that there was

1 something unusual, about the flight or the crew.,

8. Sufficient preszurep were exercised ty Agency, State,
- Air Force, and Zzacutive action wvc the Soviets to
- 7 effect the release of the-crew- as-svvo-as—poosible,_-____.__ ___ _ _

9. A ‘factor that prot vably had an important bearing was the

early acknowledzrent by the Soviet Foreign Office of

the downing of the aircraft and the attempte by the

Soviets in the early stages to mane this appear as a

deliberate violativn of the Boviet air frontier, This

tended to take tiie "play" away from the MVD and military
: intelligence, In addition, this Gvernment was stepping
in : up the pressure fur the release of the nine Army person= .
pO : nel who landed in East Germany in a helicopter, and the . - . a
: . Soviets probatly nad no desire to create a duplicate of : o

this incident, .

10. Safeguards taken ty the Agency ani the Air Force were.
such that there was no leak to the press, during the .
crew's internment, of the fact that there was. an in-'
mo o goiagence connection of the flight and crew of the
: : C-118,

D. That it 1s not believed, based on the evidence at hand, that
. the crew was drugged or otherwise tampered with medically.

EZ. That there are valuable pointa of guidance from a cover, opera-
tions, policy and code of conduct starmpeint which can be
gathered irom experiences of thece crewnen in the hands of the.
Soviets and can aid the Agency and its rersonnel in any future
situation of a similar nature in which the Soviet military and
RIS interrogators are encountered.

ION TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AGZ'CY INTERZST IN THIS MATTER: :

As All possible steps were taken during the period immediately
preceding and immediately after the rélease of the crew to
effect the minism of publicity and to safeguard ard limit

? such publicity as was given out, in omer to avoid disclos-
dng the CIA connection of the flight ani. some of its crew.

’B. Throughout the entire debriefing process in Germany and in
the U. S., the maxima care has Leen tasen to safeguard
the information taken by transcript an: classify it so that
there would be accees to the informatica therein on a need-

to-know basis and by only properly cleared persona,

RECOMMENDATIONS:

~ A. Contdrue to take all pogsible steps to prevent any disclosure
. to any unauthorized persons, particularly the press, about the
CIA personnel aboard the C118, or the true nature of the

flight.

B. Continue to take all possible steps to change the cover dosige
nation of the: units appearing in Brannon's address book to
prevent any further compromise of these units.

C. Permit no further publicity about the flight itself, in order
: to minimize the possibility of the press learning of the CIA
interest in the flight of the C-118,;

D. Carefully follow sll matters relating to the International
Court of Justice interest in this flight, 1n order to prevent

any compromise of Agency interests. ;
