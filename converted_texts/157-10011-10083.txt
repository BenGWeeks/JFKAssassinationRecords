MR. MANFREDI: On the record.
BY MR. MANFREDI:
Q Mr. Sturbitts, are you familiar with a gentleman by
the name of Frank Sturgis?
A Indeed.
ie Is your familiarity based on what you have read in
the press?
A No. It is what is contained in the files.
Q Have you caused a search to be made of CIA files,

particularly the files of the Western Hemisphere Division,
in an attempt to determine whether Mr. Sturgis ever had any

connection with the Agency?

A I have.

(0) What were the results of that search?

A Absolutely no connection, never has been.

Q When we talk about connection, are we talking about

an employment relationship?
A That is what I am sneaking of.
Q Was Mr.Sturgis ever an independent contractor of

the Agency?

A No.
Q Was he ever a contract employee?
A No.
‘
Q Was he ever a regular employee of the Agency?
A No.

lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchanje, tnis

frequently -- they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our
own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through thicd countries in Europe. It did hit the target.

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the
automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a coliplete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because
Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going
extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The
Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus
the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment
because they were used to good American equipment. And these
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

Q In your experience at the Agency can you think of
any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run
from a base in the United States?

actually stationed full-time {
A On, yes. Oh, sure. !
Q Were there any operations run out of the United |
States which involved destruction of crops or poisoning of
sugar or anything of that sort?

A What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the

Puerto Rican thing?

A Well, that is one of the things I had in mind.

Would you describe that for me?

A Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of
opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar
to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to
it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the
1
drydock or wherever it was, they had to remove the sugar and |
|

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody cane j

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it
leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

firm buy it back from the Soviets.

There just wasn't anything to eat. And Fidel was going around

with this big plan -- of course, there were a number of

experimental cattle ranches in Cuba. King Ranch had one there.

had experimental cattle ranches there and they were experiment-|

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined '

that obviously she was receiving messages and she was

sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillar-

‘on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and

indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found

it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in. .

Q Were there many activities of that type?

A, Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a larce
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty reqa-
tive, This was one of the reasons that obviously fron --
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reportin:
toiCase Officers and they would report on things in the

community, of people they thought were suspect and this type

_of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

ship was. I mean, the same reason that we establish a relation-

ship with the press in this town. There were certain things thax

and incidents that we felt should perhaps not be surfaced at any

particular time.

Qa Do you have any knowledge of use of the press -in Miami

for propaganda purposes?

A No. I really wouldn't know, but the relationship was’

a two-way street. It wasn't simply that we assisted these
people as well as they were assigint us.

Q What assistance would you render for members of
the press in Miami?

nN

A Well, in the case of Gpemittarnen

we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of
areas he periodically visited and the Chiefs of Stations
would give him background briefings and this type of thing
on the developments within a given country.

Q Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?

Q Was he also used as a source? ;
A No.
Q Do newspapermen in Washington, D.C., receive

about fronts, revolutionary fronts. How large were these

organizations?

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban

situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

A No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have
a career agent who has been with us for a good many years
in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who have relatives in Cuba.

; Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths, this
type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like
he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin,
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it. New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever. .

Q So you use Cuban, now citizens or aliens in this

country, aS access agents.
