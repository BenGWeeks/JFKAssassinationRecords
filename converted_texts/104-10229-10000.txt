i. When Wallace A, GROVERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January~
1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1
. discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving
* financial ussistancé from ANTCRLD funds and requested that
GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial assistance
following termination of ‘their AMWORLD monthly support payments.

determine ‘if the agents named dy AMBIDDY/1 had been employed by
WOFACT..in order to determine what, if any, obligation might
exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. The
results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to .
reference dependents, are Sumzarized below-for Station Manesgua

information,

CIDEN-A). Subject was a OFACT agent under contract. Ris
MOC provided payzent. of his $400 monthly salary to”
his dependent Frreats for two years following pos-
Sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission,
After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received
his -regular. monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At
that time Headguarters decided to liquidate the
remaining balance of $6400 and paid this emount ina
lump sum to the Parents. Headquarters considers that
all legal and. xorai obligations pave been discharged
and is not inclined to assume’ any further financial
obligations to the Parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently
unaware that the parents have received approximately

$10,000 from worscr.

directly employed by SOFACT, IDEN B receives $175

the AMBUD program nnd hos been paid n total of
$10,850 \from arch 1962 to date through the
DAMAVE/AYBUD cover mechanism, Presumably AMBIDDY/1
JS unaware that this dependent has been receiving
regular AMBUD assistance in addition to the $125
per month received from AMWORLD funds,

CIDEN D) AMBIDDY/1' provided GRG'ERY with the complete nane
and detatis of the activities of IDEN D's husband
prior to his arrest and subscquent 6-30 year pri-
Son sentence, With this information traces were
run on Subject. with negative results. Since neither
JMWAVE nor Headquarters records produced any evidence
Subject had ever been a WOFACT employee, no obligation
exists to provido financial assistance to IDEN B,

2. Although referenca indicates the discussion between James
D. ZABOTH and Ernest|A. LUSBY took place after AMBIDDY/1's conver-—
- sBation with GROWERY tn January, it is not clear when, or by whon,

» the B8ubject was originally. brought to ZABOTH's attention, If
AMBIDDY/1 was the nource of ZAROTI's Auformation 1t 15 noteworthy
‘that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed dis-
cussion with GROWERY..: : . a .

Several individuals who were involved with AMLEMON-~1

LE SANTE 1# tho Subject of Case #106 (evo and Martyr)

who was executed as a result of his participation in

the sabotage attompt,. MENDEZ’ CASIELLES, the Subjects ©
of Case #499, were also executed on the same charges,
RODRIGUEZ was sentenced io 30 years imprisonment which
is boing served in the Islo of Pinos Prison, : :

' The Trustee describes: himself, in tho HEW Survey
- form, ay a former employee of tho Cuban Electric Company
and a friend of the Subjects of Caso #99. He is montioned
in a 26 September 1962 AMOT. roport (AA-812; UFG-01672,..
12 Oct, '62). as residing in Miaml where he receivod
letters, containing information, from source Martha RAMOS
Castro. in Havana, Traces, show-RAMOS to bo the wife of
Armando RODRIGUEZ and the sister-in-law of tho widow of
Julio CASIPLLES,..The txvusteo stated in the HEW Survey
form that one year previously he forwarded tho accumulated
funds and started sonding $33,00 each month to RAMOS in.
Chicago, per instructions by the CASIELLES widow, and that
in May_1965 hé stoppod sending tho $33.00 paymont for the
_ MENDEZ: widow to Cuba and started holding it for hor, He
claimed to have $165.00 on hand at time of ‘the Survey,
-It°is noted ‘that JMWAVE records contatn no mention of

bohalf. of LE SANTE, MENDEZ, and CASIELLES appoar to be
banéd upon lettors from the COMANDO ELECTRICO DE LIBERACION
which are tncluded with tho AMTIKI attachment. -

In view of the Case #99 widows being in Cuba,. and -the’
failure of the trustee to Provide’ the oxact date-of-birth
for the widows in his 9 December 1966 reply to AMTIKI
(UFGA-26626, 15 Decombar 1966), Lt is not believed that he
would have the needed documents, We are, however, through
AMTIKI~1 requesting tho trusteo to provide an explanation
of his handling of the payments for both widows, and, via
his meuns of communication with them, to obtain the required

- documontation,
c. Logality of marriages:

‘SUBJECT: Review of Certain Hero and Martyr Case Files

The -"Heroes.a:nd Martyrs" cases were not considered-under
the same regulutions as the dependents of the invaders of
the Bay of Pigs... The‘persons suposed to receive payment
were ‘destgnated, in some cases by "the Department" and in
other cuses by the C.R.C. through its executives. There
are cases in which a written memorandum was given to us but -
there are others in which no memorandum was given. We were -
“instructed. to ‘pay-no more than $175.00 monthly to each, and
as it-cun be -seen, many cases are receiving lower amounta
and never the amount of dependents was taking in considera~
tion. There ts only ong case recelving a higher amount,
Mrs. Hilda R. Carballo {widow of Jesus Delgado), -who. receives
$250.00 becaune wea were specially tnstructed to pay. thig a~

mount. . .

In regards to documents, the files are very poor, and they —

“ polnts resulting from the review aro as follows:

a. Subject was executed for a prior crime in Cuba
_ and not because of participation at tho Bay of Pigs.
-(Q@urder of a Cuban seldier during Oscapo from Cuba in
March 1960). Sée “Bohenia™ clipping forwarded herewith

fact that the Cuba: exile looks at his homeland in a manner quite different
from ‘ie United Siates. Government with Its world-wide responslbilities.
« Nevertheless, he thought it important that hit-and-run raids be resumed
against Cuba to (1) xeep up the ‘hopes of the Opposition inside the island.
and (2) force Fidel to Maintain a high stato of alert which materially,
subtracts from his ‘economic efforte. Artime noted that assets ‘to make =.
these raids-are available but are not being used. He did not’ specifically ee
ask for support to resume hia activities. . oe

I told him that while his arguments had: certain inarit, there were also *
other considerations which should be kept in mind, -[, @., that hit-and-run

Of ‘payments to dependents of Brigade members killed, :

“tions made-at various times to resolve this. probles. This
lack of policy is ‘implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms |
~ to the DDCI dated 23 May. 1962 itn which he referred to a
Presidential oral directive that payments to dependents
were to be continued until termination by. Presidential _. |
order. A later ‘memorandum from Mr. Helis ‘to the. DDCI, dated
,31 December 1962, contained. commenditions for terminating -
these rionthly payments.with a lump-sum d ‘th payment to -

to a flat $100 per month and all minor dependents reduced

to. $25 per month with notification. that all payments will
