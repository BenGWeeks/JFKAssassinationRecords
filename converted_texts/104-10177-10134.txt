TRAP

Londoners face a new hazard,
another plt in the treacherous bog
of regulations that surrounds
today’s law-respecling citizens.

‘This week, careful sidesteppers
along the narrow pathways of
rectitude learned that the phone
may lead to a fine.

In our public telephone boxes
are Pwo buttons; after the money
has clicked into the box and some,
sort of response ‘been evoked the
caller presscs Button A so that
the other end can hear him. If
he gets the wrong number or none
at.“oll he presses Dutton B and
gets his money bné!
Sumetimes, the meehdhis. ap-
pears to develop anlumisunl con-
trition tn_its behaviour rnd: pours
out a shower of coins. wikby in
excrss of the Button B presser’
due TH new, this pleasant quirk
has invested the dull business of
telephoning with a certun spert-
ing quality, No call is complete
without a hopeful linge at But-
ton B.

‘The other day, it seems, 9 youth
uying to phdne his) pirt-friend
was getting no reply, which is
trouble enough, anyway Pressing
Button B, he was rewarded with
mgntpence, five more than he
‘uns entitled to If there's one sout
in the whole of London's ten
milion who wouldn't have pocket-
ed that extra fiveponce it certalnly:
wasn't our young swain, Unfort-
unately, somebody spotted his
transaction and the Ind eventually
found himself in court as wrong 3
number as anyone ever got.

They fined him ten shillings,
saying that he should have ret~
urned the other tivepence to the
box or a post-office. The author-
ues) explain that people who
forget to press Button B to regain
their money claim on the Post
Office and, therefore, snyone
pocketing money thus hurled at
them ts robbing the Postmaster
General. here may pessibly be
people who claim for the odd
forpotten threepence, but thus
column has never met even a
remate friend of one,

So something of the sport has
gone out of hfe. And a lot of
people are confratuinting them-
s‘lwrs on 4 natrow escape from

d@serace ‘There, but for the grace
of God.
