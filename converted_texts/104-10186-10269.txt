arrival may be delayed in view of NOVAS‘ present inclination for

feminine diversion.

In a report dated March 1964, this same source said that

was issued in Habana on 20 February 1964.- His home address was
given as Carman No. 18, Vibora. He arrived in Kingston from
Mexico on 18 March 1964, on Mexicana Flight Number 305.

This same source, “in a report dated 28 April 1964, stated that
..the wife of Julian:NOVAS Fernandez, the recently arrived Cuban

via Mexico. Her name is Amarilis Marta VALDES Hijuelos and
she was born on 19 May 1937, in Jiquani, Oriente, Cuba. VALDES
has been indisposed since her arrival in Kingston; this is
probably due to her advanced pregnancy. Her home address i
Cuba is Avenida 31, Number 3622, Habana. She carried diplomatic

passport D,64,/239, issued in Habana on '9 April 1964.
