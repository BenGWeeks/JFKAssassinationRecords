_. During the period under review, Subject managed to gain full-time
employment as 4 senior executive of an HBSPRITE government subsidized
scientific publication at a time of economic slowdown when jobs were
not easy to get. He did this without help from Headguarters or the

“Station. Such an achievement- is a tribute to Subject's fluency in
French, his ability to writes his general scientific know-how and his
good buisness sense. Over half of his salary therefore is now paid
py this company. In converting to full-time employment, a major ad-

* justment, subject's contribution to the Station operations in the
MEHARSH and TPFAST fields against which he is taxgetted temporarily
decreased somewhat. Subject continued, however, to maintain contact
with three local MHMARSH: officials and initiated contact with three
others. He also continued to search for new leads to personalities in
‘the priority areas assigned to him. Subject has the capability to call
on local scientists or technicians of just about any nationality with
the possible exception of TPFAST citizens. , Ha has used this. near-
unique potential well. . . . :

substantial amount of time and energy from Subject. and the unanswere

to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore
more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts
than in that of more than s.ort-range operational development.
Subject's operational. situation makes it impossible for him to
attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not
by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to
"digest" the information contained in his reports.

' Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful
with operational expenses and has exercised good security.

Ducing the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs
directed against the local MHIIARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D_ (continued)

substantial. In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,
although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred
an "S" rating for specific duty number one; Subject, may ultimately
deserve an "0", but it does net seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "Pp" category, rather than "Ss",
but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
wno is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a

| frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and'only time will reveal to
what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be«
half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely
and will be commenting upon it subsequent ly. as we gain experience

and knowledge.

S¥ REVIEWING OF FICIAL

MENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL : .
As previous Station correspondence and fitness reports will reflect, this

officer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years.

In fairness to him, however, in is equally true that an officer under non-official

cover reflects, ‘in the level ‘and quality of his performance, the amount and type

of guidance, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside case

officer. Making allowances for these variables, this officer's past record has not

_been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved sub-
iod under review, and that ic the Station

stantially during the latter part of the pert ¢ Sta
can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input

from the Organization, -his continued presence at this Station definitely
appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite
conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat |
longer period than that reflected by this report,

' On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to
greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more
aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity
to the primary Station targets. This officer does bring many talents to bear
on his.operational activity: he has absolutely fluent French, a solid and
exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community.
Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in
depth, sclect those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue
Ui actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina.
tion from further development, for whatever reason, :

In sum, in spite of the recognized md commendable improvement in this |
officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits

‘that the letter grade for specific ‘duties 2 and 4 would more properly have

been a''P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately
be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than

the latter,

Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared
the Fitness Report. :

ADDENDUM, Form 45 (Fitness Report), for period March 67-March 68.

Section D

As the individual being rated, I would like to add some remarks to
those prepared by the rating officer. : .

The assignment I have includes managerial respensibilities which:
(a) are essential to the continued existence and security of the.
cover mechanism as a vehicle for operational exploitation, and
(b) are not necessarily visible to those "on the inside." .

In the case of (a), I must engage in a constant orchestration of

“the cover and the facilities it offers. This means maintaining

a managerial equilibriwn to insure that cover work will not
become, of itself, so demanding that it negates the cover's

-utility-to the CS, In effect, the.top officers and middle

managers of the cover corporation fwho are not cleared and witting}

- fave to be satisfied that their demands are met (or cannot be), or
-@lse- manipulated in order. to neutralize or reject their demands.

After all, the cover position is to them a legitimate, normal,
workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding,

_.it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standards
of thorseughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the case of (b) -- which derives from (a) -- and can prove to

be so demanding that the needs of the CS could no longer be served,
the incumbent is required to manage a span of huinan contacts at
several. levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance

“its value to the CS, This means planning, directing and

managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of
technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiatians to
improve the {cover firm's] relations with similarly widespread
individuals at the levels of editor-in-chief, publisher, corporate
vice-president, president; and chairman of the board. These
levels are scattered not, only through industry, but have their

‘analogs as well in government, higher education, and professional

‘societies.

Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied-
areas operating component of a major field Station, I can report
quite honestly that my present managerial responsibilities exceed
the former -- despite the apparent lack of “supervisory .
responsibilities” in my present position. : .

. Since the Reviewing Officer in the field has not indicated his views

on this Fitness Report, I would Like to make a comment of my own. Without
wishing to detract fron anything the Supervisor has said about Subject's per-
formance, I feel obliged to note that the ratings given him in this report are
higher than those given, for example, to any Branch Chief in this Division, and,
as such, are inconsistent with the grading pattern of the Division asa whole. .

approaches to operational problexs and: personalities, and expends considerable’
effort in maintaining a level of specialized knowledge suffictent to backstop his
cover and to ensure the maximum exploitation of his contacts with target organi-
zations and. individuals. His comiand of spoken, written, and technical French is

excellent.

From the. point of view of supervision, this employee in his ‘present position re-

” quires. guidance only insofar as to identify specific. targets and for him to protect

himse}f in situations where he dees not have, by virtue of his not having access to
official files, spectalized information. ‘Otherwise, he requires no supervision
other -than. the periodic provision of policy and operational directives. :

This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of
operational and administrative reports, including financial accountings, and his

‘reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing

the risks inherent in the Iack of access. .to classified storage, leaves nothing to
be desired. . . - a .

: Other than the funds for operational activities, this employee currently has no
responsibility, for the programing and use of personnel, space, equipment, and
funds. . :

With respect to dedication to his job, (this employee has practically speaking
single-handedly built his present | over/operational position despite a number of
negative factors inherent to hiss tuation such as: relative isolation, meager oppor-
tunity for contact with his “professtfonal ‘group; and expensive area of assignment,
and an exposed cover situation where the necessity for living cover is compounded
by thie necessity of avoiding wistakes which ‘might Jecpardize cover. His dedication
to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment, and his willingness
to continue on in it, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would per=- ,
haps justifiebly feel that his present assignment may leave him outaide the main-
stream of competitive organization. progression.

“This’ employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his
proven mobility in “the execution of operational assignments attests.

It should further be noted that with respect to the problem endemic to deep-cover
assignments of allocation of time between cover work and operational activity, this
employee comes very close to the happy norm of making cover work complement opera-
tional work, and making operational work contribute where possible to the enhance-

ment of cover.

While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a one-man show, it

is recommended that serious consideration be given to expanding the operational com-
plex which he has created: in order to capitalize on his experience, the work he has

put in to date, and his own management capabilities.

SECTICN C + NARRATIVE COMMENTS

The assignment of this employee to the field under non-official cover
was designed to compensate for the loss of an employee in an official cover
slot which was cut from the Station"s ODACID allotment of personnel ‘positions.

During the reporting period this employee has accomplished with success ‘
the convincing establishment of his cover in a complex milieu, and has been
accepted -as legitimate -by his professional colleagues, the persons whom he
meets under cover, and the French authorities. It should be noted that his
ability to assume his cover has been largely the result of his om efforts
over a period of years to acquire and maintain a familierity with the general

scientific field.

During the reporting period he has developed a wide circle of contacts
in the selentific and journalistic fields and applies a long background in
a variety of assignments 4n KUDOVE to the determination and asgessment of
operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his cover
organization; in which only four persons are witting of his actual status,
has sfiown itself to be more than satisfied with his performance of his cover’

duties. :

‘mis empioyee requires a& minim of detailed operational supervision;

it 1s necessary in specific cases only to indicate the operational or infor-:
mational objectives.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to
detail and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station

to a minimun.

Tis employee uses the French language continuously, and his facility
4s such as to permit him to handle himself excellently in a@ broad range of .
complex technical subjects. He has in addition undertaken specialized French
language training to develop this capability further. His. operational re-
porting is excellent both with regard to elarity and pertinence. .

In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most

part in fields waere it will complement, and be complemented by, his in-
dependent operational activities and cover work.

in production and in‘the creation of both short and long-term assets for his
unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in

TO: Chief of Station — : .

FROM: Chief, Soviet Branch

: SUBIRCT Jnorase RICHARDSON = Recommendation for Promotion

1. Jacques Richardson has bean under wy supervision as Deputy and
Case Officer: for approximately fifteen months. Based on the knowledge of

“Richardson as an individual gained during this period and upon his actual '

performance, I recommend that bs be entered for consideration on the SR
Division GS-1 to GS-15 promotion list at this time ~ June 1957. The slot
and job which he now occupies, Chief, Soviet Eranch, is, of course, adequate °

..te accommodate euch a promotion.

2. Richardson's operational performance has been outstanding and

, notsbly versatile during this period, He hes engaged primarily in liaison
and has been personally effective in terms of results achieved almost daily,.
4n terms of reports, operational data, and joint enterprises while, overall,’

he has established enduring professional relationships from which the
organisation as a whole should benefit for soma time to come. In addition, '
Richardson has handled a number of unilateral cases most effectively. In '
the office, too, as well as in face-to-face operational situations, Richardson
has deen outstanding. He has a flair for and a facility with the written word
as evidenced by the amount of general and particular correspondence which he’
has initiated, and he knows the organizational “drill” intimately and from way
back, Thus, I feel that he is qualified for “he recommended promotion by
ability and experience in both the internel and external aspects of the

profession.

3, ‘Relative to the more personal characteristics imolved in the tern:
managerial ability, judgments are recessarily more subjective. but here, too,
I consider Richardson to be qualified in maturity, in judgnent, and in - .
experience. He would most certainly be a supervieor who. could perform all ,
the chores or handle all the situations which h+ would ba calling upon
subordinates to take care of, in itself, the beginning of any good supervisory
relationship. In actual fact, he has had considerable experience in this

_ regard already and the principal shortcoming I have noticed is a tendency to
"carry" others by an extension of his om industry.

Richarison is not without
tts difficulties in the area of personal relationships. He is a purist at '
times and manifestly impatient in certain human situations where a shrug of,
the shoulders would be the best reply. These characteristics do not always
make for the best personal relationships but are frequently obviated by
intellect and above all are correctable and are being corrected.
