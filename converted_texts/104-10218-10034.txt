LEFTIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES-Soviet Directed Insurgency | 1h an!
Monthly CI Report (S)_(Gp-1) A Soviet Embassy official in Mexico City, | 4
OSI District 30 Nikolai S.' LEONOY, is allegedly actively planning an insur- ;
May 1963 gent movement in Latin America... LEONOV left Mexico for the

USSR on 21 April to confer with: KHRUSHCHEV and CASTRO. i
aa t Credence is given this report: ‘by the publication of a photo~
Dt ¥
“| he" \ae graph of the three on 8 May in.a Cuban newspaper. The pho- -
wv . tograph was purportedly taken during a recent neeting. .

}
. (S) (Gp-1) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV's j
au schemes, would serve as bases for the insurgency... Cuba H
é would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for.
covert distribution of arms. .- : ‘
Carel : a en (S) (Gp-3) The individual selected as the contact man
: for arms acquisition is said to have been engaged in simi-~
| lar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.

(8) (Gp-3) Another report from sources in Colombia
stated. that pro-CASTRO ex-President CARDENAS planned to
call a meeting in Mexico City of "leftist bent", disgrun-
tled retired military officers from Latin American coun-
‘tries on the subject of insurgency. (DIA, 3 June 1963).
