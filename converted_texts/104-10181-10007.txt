1. Forwarded herewith is a contact ‘report: freer PACHANKIS on his follow-up

interview cf Alexander SANKO (201-866054), which concerns SAMKO"s contact with

AMAUTO/1 (201-735296)" in Madrid. As can be seen frea the report, Madrid Station's
defensive briefing of SAMKO apparently. took effect and he has been ¢autious in

avoiding the many suspicious characters that have appeared since his trip to
i a

Madrtd. 4
2. The question. of his writing to AMAIID/T was aentioned by SAMNO. He was
told that AMAUTO/1 was back in Cuba and we did aot know when he would return to
Madrid, if evers Miami belfeves we should waite until AMALTU/} retums to
Madrid, or seme other poset tn the Free World, and then hava SAMM) write to him.

3, Despite SYKO's nowly self-discevered Inmes Bond talents PACHANKIS
enjoyed handling him. It also appears that our prisary objective, contact with
AMAUIU/L for a face to face assessment, has been met.

coe Se Ss 2o-suly 1970 > es.

Contact Report on Alexander SAMKO, on 28 July 2970,

1. On the morning of 28 Suly, Tt called Sam to check in with hin. °°

after. being away on’ TSY for
.bpset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed

almost 6 weeks. -He sounded a bit

him at ease.

2. itt was plain. to see that the trip had changed him. He is now
: a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Sond. He told
me all sorts of wild stories about being tailed in. Madrid “by

7 or’ 8 .'Chivatos' (Castro agents," and leading them on long

"8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid,” Castro agents were, also
“yatching" him on the day

he-was in Barcelona and on the short
layover his Pan Am plane had in Lisbon on his way home. at no
time, however, was he molested by these "agents,"

-so San says— in Hollywood.
"About the second night after I got home," c. 14-15 June, a car
parked across the street and a little to the rear of his house
"after it got dark." When Sam got into his car and went -to the
gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volxswagen,
without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trip in :
the neighborhood and back to -his home. He could not make out
the physical description of the driver of the VW. He has~never~

seen this car again.

:

} 4. ‘The only other suspicious individual near his home, was "a tall,

; . thin man," (described as-about 5-11 to 6 ££ and 170 lbs; black

i : hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slacxs and
+ .waite shirt, another .tine wearing a suit). This individual showed

ie up across the street from his home "just as the sua had gone cown,

4 Several evenings during the first weex that 2 got home.” (ce. 14-18

; Sune) The man just walked past the front back ard forth a faw tin

: and appeared: to have his car around ‘the cornes of Sam's house.

: could not identify the car or anything else about the mane

} ‘ Se. “Again, during the first week after his return San received several
telephone calls where no one would answer when the phone was picked
up, or the person calling would say, "sorry, wrong number." San
has not experienced any other suspicicus incidents after

week home from Spain. i should note that Saa soes not ta

x
: these incidents with fear, but rather‘in the vein of a paperback
detective story. : .
: Gs. Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himsel! soméwhat in Macrie as
. a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxur. hotel,
ate as‘well as drank. well, saw the sites and even went tO a night
club, ail on the house, He went so far as to say that if he had
“xnown'it was going to be like this, I never would have gone." Yes,
in the-same breath, he told "iliiam" that he would be back in
Spain in September, Of Souese, Sam would go again if we asked hin, .

ng we wish I-promised to check out the status of the

Case with my office and Madrid to see what course of action they

Geen should be initiated; : Lo

Modesty ‘not being one of his greatest virtues Sam rambled and

-.Tasbled about ‘the. "secrats" he’ got _out of "dilliam" and passed

‘en-to the Madrid c/o. I went along with him and complimented him

‘done; which is-true. But, he was not satisfied with
hat Washington, said?" To which I
lami thought you did an
excellent! job and we are. most grateful for your cooperation.” - He
ike2 that very much; you could see it in the smile on his face,
He tries to make it sound like it was a great ordeal and sacrifice
on his part to-go to Spain to see "Willian," but he; cannot hide:

.On a job wel

“his anxiety to get on. the next plane to Madrid, and the good life there.

I pointed out that "Villian" is now back in Cuba and there is no

ineication of when he will return’ . Nevertheless, Sam feels he

should write him "because the letter will be sent to Cuba to him."

Zt assured him that I would get a reading on this matter and have

an answer for him sonetine next week, At that time, I promised. to
take him and his Close friend Masip to lunch. - Sam gave me an | Lt
extensive and expensive expense aécount oF chis trips” “I will’ attempt
to: decipher it at the close of this report. . .

We ended the meeting on very cordial terms. He was not so mad at
not being contacted so such as he is dying to get back on’ the gravy
train, and so much time has passed by without word to or from
"William." Sam asked Tor some way jn which he can contact us
"right away” if "Willian" notifies him "that he's ready to juns
You know when he junss won't have much time.” fF pointed cut
shat af present ewillian” is in Cuba and the prosnects of hin
deflecting from. Cuba right-now are very slin indeed, We would, however,
take this into considgeration after “dilliam" retucns to Spain or

another foreign post. We will be seeing each other next week to

Clear up the accounting (we owe him money, he says) and have lunch.

“2. On the evening.

at an out-door restaurant. t
rehearsing his cover Story, reviewing the objective:
trying to anticipate questions. .AMNAUTO-1 might ask: dui

“their meeting together SAMKO was given” ith

‘foremost objective

relationship ‘that: ex:
from the. United States,

be, To’ ‘exchange addresses and telephone
numbers for the purpose of sending occasional, .
‘greetings to one another. : ae
. .€, TO, invite’ AMAUTO-1 (and his wife, “if”
- necessary) to dinner, at his expense.

d. To ascertain AMAUTO-1's, future ‘plans,

. e. To assess AVAYTO-1's feelings toward
the United States and toward his own government, |

f. For SAMKO to talk favorably about the
United States using himself as an example, (the
son of ‘immigrant parents who made good in business);
to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone
with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness.

g. If the opportunity presented itself,
ates . to show sympathy for the apparent failure of the
“Cuban Government to reach the 10 million ton
Sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment
of this goal would adversely affect the economic
development of Cuba. It was our hope that some-
time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would
volunteer to discuss his country's economic .
situation which might have opened the conversation
to further exploitation by SAMKO. -

h, Paralle) with objective e. above, SAMKO
was instructed to ask (provided an appropriate opening
appeared in the conversation) AMAUTO-1 for his
personal comments on the Vietnam issue and anti-war
demonstrations in the United States and abroad, We
were trying to draw out AMAUTO-1's personal analysis
‘of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the war in Vietnam
and to compare his statements with -the Cuban Government
position . oe ‘ . . -

3. Although, SAMKO was determined to see AMAUTO-1 even
if’ he had to camp outside AMAUTO-1's home, we reminded him
that because of ANAUTO-l's position, he might refuse to see
SAMKO in his home, but that SAMKO should not hesitate to

SAMKO said he wanted to see "el Senor",
The maid said’ he wasn't in. He explained to
the maid that it was "very importante” to
see the Senor, By this time another maid
“appeared,.shown in this photo, and she gets
‘into the act. She repeats that el Senor is
not in. SAMKO, sensing he wasn't getting
anywhere, changed his tactics and asked to
-O see "la senora", The maids went into indivi-
dual monologues, but SAMKO could not understand
what they were saying. Finally, SAMKO produced
“a note, which’-he was asked to prepare, and
‘handed it. to the maid in this photo. SAMKO
“repeated that it was "very importante to see_

the activities from the front entrance.

toward the driveway. SAMKO spots him and
calls out, "Bill, don't you remember me,
it's SAMKO." Bill replies, "SAMKO, muy bien,

he put on weight and asked where his boy was.

4. During the conversation in AMAUTO-1's home, SAMKO
began his deliberate softening of AMAUTO-1 with such comments
as “you know Bill, Julio was Jealous of you because I treated
you like a brother: J didn't-want you to return to Cuba, but
I couldn't Stop you. We were'all in favor of Castro." Bill
admitted here that SAMKO was a §00d friend and enjoyed his job
and the pay was good, but added that "I had to go. 1 was in
the States illegally." " SAiKo- added "you.know, Bill, I never
was blessed with any children; you were like a son to me, but
when I heard you died in the mountains in Cuba, I blamed myself
for letting you go." Bill replied that he was wounded on his
left side.- SAMKO explained that if AMAUTO-1 was in the States
illegally, SAMKO could have arranged for him to remain in. the
States by getting assistance from some police and detective
‘friends in’Florida., SAMKO repéated his delight to again see
AMAUTO-1 and how happy he was to know he is alive.

5. Moments .after entering the howe, AMAUTO-1 invited
him to have breakfast. ‘SAMKO refused, but settled for a beer.
AMAUTO-1 excused himself, went .to the phone and called an
unidentified party, . SAMKO could not understand ‘the conver-
sation, but SAMKO and Station officers suspect that he called
his embassy or one of his colleagues, possibly advising him
of SAMKO's presence, (It is:also possible that AMAUTO-1

business interests, but -if you were there with me, Bill, you
“could have handled my affairs and you might have been a
millionaire today." SAMKO sensed that AMAUTO-1 and his wife.
“Were moved by this comment and were literally drooling with
the thought of being millionaires, The wife asked a number

of questions regarding SAMKO's wealth, his real estate activity,
collection of silver and his success in general, The wife
was astounded with the Simple explanation of how SAMKO went
about building and financing apartment houses. SAMKO made :
a Suggestion that AMAUTO-1 invest in silver because the scarcity .
of this metal would eventually raise the market value. He

explained to AMAUTO-1 that he was collecting all silver coins

stamped prior to 1965. The next couple of hours were spent

at the amusement park where, on arrival, AMAUTO-1 steered

SAMKO to a cafeteria near.the main entrance. In short order

two men arrived on .the scene, friends of AMAUTO-1. They were
introduced to SAMKO, but’ SAMKO could ‘not remember the names,

introduced to S!MKO. (SAMKO could not identify the persons

friends took a number of photographs of SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 and

after a short while together, they left. The conversation at

the park'‘was aimless,’ They discussed the kids and SAMKO repeated

how delighted and Proud he was to know that one of AMAUTO-1'S :
children was named. Alexander - his namesake, AMAUTO-1 had

-& wide grin while SAMKO was talking’ about Alexander. He asked
AMAUTO-1 about the oldest boy. AMAUTO-1 replied that the oldest

was in Havana Studying civil enginecring. SAMKO suggested to
ANAUTO-1 that he Should give his children the best education and

have them stay away from politics and political courses but
concentrate on the professional fields, engineering, law,

medicine, etc, AMAUTO-1 admitted that his intention was to

keep. his children away from a political career, SAMKO said he

would send Alexander some commercial slides of Cape Kennedy

it was his private "pad", His comment was:"you sure live it up
well." As PACHANKIS aptly explained in one of his reports,
SAMKO's ‘temper does rise. He was highly excited during the
meeting because he was asked to leave the hotel room, Since

- the reservation was made for four days, he was asked to leave.

He pleaded with SACODER to do something to keep him in the hotel
room or risk losing the opportunity to lunch with AMAUTO-1
because AMAUTO-1 was to call him at the hotel on Saturday,

6 June. SACODER admitted the error but added that there was

a simple solution if he could not convince the hotel manage-
ment to allow him to stay a few more days. SACODER suggested
that he should explain to the manager that 1) his laundry had
not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an important phone
call on Saturday and that there was no way of vetting in touch
with the caller, . Failing this, SACODER offered another simple
solution. Since SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 had not yet exchanged
addresses, SAMNKO could return to the AMAUTO-1 home and give

the maid a note advising AMAUTO-1 that he had to change hotels.
(SAMKO admitted that he told AMAUTO-1 about the possibility of ©
having to leave the hotel because his reservation ended soon.)
SAMKO did not at first accept this logic, but SACODER explained

“that he (SACODER) could not plead with the hotel management

on..SAMKO'sS behalf. ‘This was poor security. SAMKO accepted :
this and after a glass of scotch and water admitted that the
solution was indeed simple, but he was terribly excited at first.

9. Throughout the debriefing SAMKO revealed the following:
He was born in Pertin Amboy, New Jersey on 2 November 1907 to
Polish parents. At the age of 14-15 he worked-as a construction
hand on a ‘bridge being built in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.
Later, he worked on the construction of the Anhauser Yeast
Factory in Oldbridge, New Jersey. He married in 1930. During
the hard years, his wife worked in a factory while he roamed
the streets looking for employment. In the early 40's he
worked for Dupont reportedly on the atomic bomb project, but
specifically with U-235. After the war he applied for work

by WH/Miami, He was told that-PACHANKIS probably would not
visit with him for about two wecks after his return and that he
should not attempt to get in touch with PACHANKIS. He under-
stood why this was necessary and agreed with the briefing.

If a luncheon could be arranged, SAMKO was asked to concentrate
on the following: (in addition to the requirements: he was given
before his first meet with AMAUTO-1)

A. try to ascertain AMAUTO-1's future, his.
ambitions, - -his next possible assignment.

criticism for this failure, and show:sympathy.

11. “SAMKO had no difficulty convincing the hotel manage-
ment. that he had to remain in the hotel until Saturday, 6 June.

SES. at luneh “SANKO and J AMAUTO-1 ‘again reminisced.
They discussed. the following: .

vA. In one of his references, ‘AMAUTO-1 said
| that, men like him are needed - in Cuba and
"noted. that ae would probably die fighting o
for Cuba which is young and aggressive, .
but-that some day it will be a great .
‘country; that. he has been. fighting ‘011.
-his life’ to relieve the oppressed and
* yepeated that he will die fighting.
(it is interesting to note SAMNKO's reaction
cheré to AMAUTO-1's statement. When SAMKO -
first visited AMAUTO-1 on 31 May, he was
certain that under the facade of being a
devoted revolutionary AMAUTO-1 was indeed a
capitalist at heart, but at this meeting
SAMKO modified his comment by adding that
it appears AMAUTO-1 is truly a communist,
who maintains strong convictions of the
righteousness of the revolution. The above
comments by AMAUTO-1 produced’ the peg. on
which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity
of AMAUTO-1's statement on freeing the
oppressed, but he was' not specifically
a - instructed to maintain a polemic argument
~ "on the rights and wrongs of the revolution
‘because we felt this objective was secondary
to the re-establishment of a relationship
between these two old friends, A future
meeting might include the exchange of*an
- objective appraisal of the revolution as

seen by: SAMKO.)

B. AMAUTO-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an
intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea food
in the United States. He explained that
‘the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in

"SAMKO, you're like a father to me, please
think about it (the agency)? AMAUTO-1
explained that SAMKO could earn about $200,000
a-year in commission based on sales of
$2,000,000. SAMKO said he would think about
ait, but privately to SACODER he said that
he had no‘intention to disturb his’ retirement

'. Théy exchanged addresses. SAMKO had
printed his address, but AMAUTO-I asked
him'to write it on another piece of
paper. AMAUTO-1 reasoned that he wanted
“it written to understand it better, but we
believe! he will use the sample to compare
it with letters SAMKO might send in the -

* future... They promised to write to each

other. SAMKO was given AMAUTO-1's private

address, not that of the embassy, .

G. AMAUTO-1 regretted that SAMKO had to
leave so. soon because he would have
enjoyed showing SAMKO the Spanish
interior, SAMKO said he might consider
returning near the end of 1970, but
AMAUTO-1 did not ‘say whether he would
be in Spain in late 1970,

H. AMAUTO-1 said he was Suspicious when
he first saw SANKO noting that the nature
-and importance of his position make him
act suspicious, but the Suspicion soon
dissipated - so he said,

“14. On Saying their last goodbyes at the hotel, both
men embraced and again promised to keep in touch through
correspondence, At this point the Operation was over. SAMKO
-WaS met late that evening. He was taken to a new safehouse,.

15, Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed
and rehearsed were Successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater
than our own expectations. Unless we are misjudging the shrewd-—
ness of AMAUTO-1 through our own naivete, we believe the ,
relationship was Sincerely re-established and a channel opened
for future use by AMAUTO-1 Should he desire to use this channel
other than to maintain a friendly correspondence, It was un~

', fortunate that his Barcelona trip interfered possibly to the
point of SAMKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAUTO-1
nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, SAMKO admirably
fulfilled our requirements and courageously maintained the
fiction of his visit to Spain, We believe too, that although
AMAUTO-1 appears to be Solidly in favor of the Cuban regime,

when ‘the "Ambassacor", his boss (indirectly) spoke so favorably
of the U.S. ANNARTINI-1‘s wife, on the other hand, said that
Lydia Mendez was having a somewhat similar problem with
Nilda Ruiz. The latter was expecting again at the time and
after five boys, Lydia suggested that she (Nilda) probably
wished for a girl. "Not at all", said Nilda. "I don't want
a daughter of mine to go into agricultural work at fourteen
years of age", she exclaimed setting Lydia back, AMMARTINI-2
pointed out that the Ruiz couple has a 14 year-old son in Cuba --
a “hostage” while they are abroad. They might be willing to
defect, according to AMNMARTINI-1, if it weren't for leaving the

to stay. in Hadrid,, then le} them go dirictly to Cuba. -...

Nilda says that CHAII's s claw is foinr to Morocco as

Cuban ‘ambassador. one that he had as his secretary.

When Alfara was in Madrid he said that the son-in-law had

sneither the personality nor the qualifications for the position.
Ruiz ‘says that if they are referring to the head of Chain's

her if 1¢ is her first trip to furope. She says it is her first
trip to Western Europo, but that she has already been in the
socialist countries of Europe. Ruiz asks them what Havana thought
about De la Nuez. ‘Rutz says it isn't worth hav'nr an aprument -
or quarrel with the "“alleco" becanso of De la Nuez. Ruiz : i
believes that the whole af"alr was handled by “he C.T. A.

Ruiz asks them who has «eon raned ambassavor to Morocco, and ‘hey
confirm the fact that the husband of his dauchter (CHAIN-?) has
been appointed. .

They return to the topkof De la Nuez. Rutz says the only thing
they know is thet he has sone, but they dontt know where. In

industrial and commercial people, or even enltural people, they:
would get nothing done here. when they give a reception it is {
because of work, to maintain contacts, find things out, and not ‘
for any other purpos9. They have nothine to do there, and he
is not zoing to invite them to just come and eat and-drink . :
When they have to spend some pesetas they do it, but for questinns

and all the services will be together. There will also be some
community rooms, such a5 a library, a recreation rcom, A dining
room with a bar, that they will all have a chance to seo, but
-this is going to take probably a year. It will be on Avonida

de la Havana, Meanwhile they arc putting un with this place
pecause they only ney $50,00 for it, and Havana finds its a rift.
If they were paying.S500, by now they wonlintt be here; they
would have found some other place, Ther have the place rented
since 1936, and even thourh they have spent more than a thongsand
(or one hundred thousand) in fixing it, it is still an old house.

With this new arrival he talks about the children, and the problems .

never has cormitted an-error, and has always’ handled everything
with great tact and in faver of his governzent, even when he has
had to deal with Falanzists.

accusing him of in Havana, Rut, there is no one that has the

i. QUTIMID: periodically has reported contact between
t and: Guillermo 'R U IZ Perez, the Cuban. Minister
” adrid, mostly over the telephone but also indicating’
that he has séen her -pérsonally. It would appear that he
has: taken unusually strong interest im her, consibvring the

“number of other more ‘demanding tEsks he claims to have.

Until now, we have not been able to identify cither Subject
or her relationship with RUIZ.

2. On 28 May QUDOZE (a sensitive joint audio penetration
with liaison) reported the following memorandum (presumably
to Havana) on Subject as dictated by RUIZ:

"Sr. RUIZ Ojeda, Some months ago we received
a ciphered cable dealing with Aiaa Rosa CORREA Felipe
asking that we contact her to determine her situation.
At that time we informed you that said Aida Rosa CORREA,
married to Pedro ECHEVARRIA_, Portuguese
citizen who was in Cuba during 1959-1968, intended
to return to our country, abandoning her husband
because of his alcoholism,

"Approximately/6ne Seek ago the brother of
Aida Rosa CURREA - Luis 47C OR REA Felipe 0°

Today we interviewed Aida Rosa CORREA and her

attitude toward this Embassy concerning her
return, We have Ict her know that given the
circumstances of her presence in Spain - not. as

_ @ "ygusano" but us the wife of a foreign doctor

“who, has worked in our country - we saw no :
‘difficulty. to’ prevent her from returning, especially
taking into account the fact that she expressed ,
herself as a revolutionary, ‘but that first we
“had to receive official permission,

- In our opinion, ‘because the situation ‘in
_ which she finds hérself in ‘Spain because of
marriage’ toa foréimer, her return can be

Access: a. Rolando CARDOSO Perez (Al8.239 674). Arrived in the
‘ U.S. on 10 October 1968 from Madrid, Spain. Ke knows _
Subject because he and Subject are cousins (Subject's
mother and Rolando's mother are sisters). When Rolan=
do arrived in the U.S., he said he was going to re~

_8ide at 940 sw llth Avenue, Miami, Florida, talephona
number 377~3877. Wa have not been able to locate hin
because we were told at this address that Rolando had

. _left for another state and that his Present address
‘ was-unknown to them). Rolando saw Subject for the last
time at the Rarajas Airport, Madrid, Spain, on 10 Oc-

_ tober 1968, when Rolando was going to take the plane
which brought him to the u.s. _ According to Rolando,
they greeted each other on that occasion. Rolando
said he had seen Subject at this same airport in early. .
or mid-1968 and that they had talked for approximately
five minutes. On this opportunity, Subject was at the

airport waiting for the arrival of a group of Cuban

‘diplomats. .

are sisters). Manuel saw Subject for the last time
in 1963, at the home of Subject's mother, where thoy
happened to meet. According to Manuel, he and Subject

stated that he wold later leave for 423 Wast 49th

5, Street, Now York, N-¥., hano of Antonio GOMEZ Lenua.

-'Manuel told”! 2 that he and his friend, Jorga BORGES
Dobarros, were’ homosexuals and had bean living together ©
since. approxinately - 963. (Jorge BORGES Dobarros ar=
rived in Miani-aboard the: same Rafugee Airlift flight.-

‘ .ag-Manuél, Ha is-a brother of Mercedes BORGES Dobarros,

.,and'he and Manuel went to live in Mercedes' house when

they arrived in Miami). : .

ve that Manuel cannot be used in an approach
© Subject because they have not maintained. relations
_.f0r a long period of years. In addition, Subject night
‘know Manuel! waakness’ (homogexualism) “and might taka .
_ advantage of this. knowledge to blackmail Manuel, Ma-
“nuel also. told 1-122 that he had received psychiatrie
treatment in Havana. :

-. Assesaments Subject's present position; the positions, all of thom
: important which he has held before; and the fact that
he has been reported as a DGI officer, lead us to be-
lieve that wo do not have many possibilities of success
din-an attempt to recruit or defact Subject. Tho fact
. that Subject's fathor has been a militant Comaunist
since prior to 1959 and that Subject's wife has been
reported as a supporter. of the xogine should not be

forgotten,

Subject‘s revolutionary background during the struggle
against BATISTA seems to indicate that he is in favor
‘of acts of terroriem. This gave hin knowledga and ex=
porience in matters related to subversive activities
and/or intelligence activities which ha could use later,

Therefore, we believa that Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Pe-~
rez must be a very useful person for tha Cuban regime,
in Spain. Ha-has experience in negotiating trade agree-
ménts and in handling administrative affairs (he has
beon working in this field for more than ten years).

All this knowledgé and experiance added to his know=
ledge and experience in subversive and intelligence
affairs make him a man who is not oftan found inthe 4.
Castro regime. : ..
