ATTENTION © : Mr. John Greaney

SUBJECT : James Garrison

1. Per our conversation in the environs of the DD/P's
office on 19 December, we have just received from {London|Sta-
tion a,scrap of information on Subject's activities. [MI-5, 7*4
the(British] Security Service, has provided the following in
a report on Americans who are in correspondence with the
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation:

"Jim Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans,
Louisiana

A secret and reliable source has reported that the
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation has been in touch
. with Jim Garrison. Our source states that the ini-
pee tiative in this contact appears to have come from
— the Foundation and the purpose of it seems to be to
persuade Garrison to write an article about the
late President Kennedy's assassination which pre-
sumably the Foundation could use in some way."
