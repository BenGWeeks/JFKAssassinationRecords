was considered that, if thie letter were a Soviet intelligence
comamication, it vas likely the Soviets would consider the oper-
etion compromised when cur souree's possession of the letter vas
reported. For this reason, we decided it was bect to forge & copy

b. Antin NYCZYPORUK (according to GHYP his true nano is
RYKYPCRETZ) was born about 1910. He ig married and had a wife and
tye children in liogingk. Pricr to 1944. he vas a professor of
Ubrainian and West Zurcpeen Literature at 8 pedegogical ijastitute . 1
in Kev. NYCGYPOKUK Left the USSR in 1944; from 1545 to 1948 he !
was in an International Kefugee Organization carp in Salzburg, i
Austria; be has resided is France since 1945. |

&. The following details on GHYP's and RYCZYPORUK's involvement H
with Soviet intelligence were obtained by our scuree from GHYP and :
other Ukrainian enigres in France. During the period 1954 to 1960 GHYP i
and Vasiliy MYAKUSHO, Third Secretary of the Soviet Delegation to UNESCO, H
frequently visited with eech other at the Soviet Eubassy and st GHYP's ~ .
apartment ca 211 Rus de Bercy. At the end of 1959 GMP introduced
BRYCZYPORUK to MYAKUSHKO. MYAKUSHKO asked HYCZYPOEUK to contribute Literary
articles to Soviet publications; it is not known whether HYCZYPORUK wrote
any such articles. Parly in 1340 SYCZYPCHUK developed a persecution com
plex and was confined to © senitarium for a short period. GUYP, fearing
that NYCZYPORUK might expose the GHYP-NYAKUSJEO relationship, provided
BRYCZYPCRUK with free poard end lodging in his apartment and with spending
money. MYAKUSHKD dropped NYCZYPORK ag soon es the latter's mental cone

: @iticn became obvious. In Kay 1960 the Soviet iubassy edvised NYCZYPORUK
to reyatriate to the US&R as scon as possitie, and offered to help locate
‘Hits family in the USaR. (As you already know, in October 1960 the Soviets
‘ent NYCZYPORUK a letter reporting his family was not in Roginsk. See
attachment.)

$. There ie a rumor in the Ukrainian exigre colony in Paris that
BYCZYPORUK has been a Soviet agent since about 1949. This is based on
bia close relationship with Jozef (aka Osyp) KOZAK since 1949. KOZAK
Bored to France from Munich in 1946. Until his expulsion in 1950 he
vag ued ective in the Organization of Utreinian Nationala/Bandera
(OUR/B) in France. He was ousted from the CUR/B because of his excessive

i euriceity about CUN/B members and their relatives in the UGSR. Subsae
i quently it was learned that KOZAK vas in contact with the Soviet Imbassy

in Freace, KOZAK ig presently reaiding ot 26 rue Gaston Jaillon, Vesines

refer to me letter costazrked in i iphia as Letter #1 and me
one postmarked in the US52 as Letter 72.

2. In order to Sacklit.

Eecause of the reouivencnt that the letters be left in zood

nion consisted cf the customary visual and U.Y. insoection

long wave and ve), and the soecalied KEXFOTE test,
id Lester test baa only r tly beca introduced and constitutes
the most formidable teat kiown to us azainst Si, 1+ ws by means of
this test that the presence of Sd in letter #1 becaze apparent. In

Le , the enplication of this test a vortion of the SW is actually physically
lifted from the iten bodng tested and subsequently tnrough a process
involving both chemical and Sical reactions, the o1 is. made visible.
ihe degree of visibility varies from cowpletely nezative results to
comleiely lecitle exes, ‘fccording to the technician tho verforned
this te3t the resvlts ootaincd with Letter #1 were not quits legible,
but definite enocga to serciv checking to establish that they were
not due to the visible inx of the letter. ‘the time inverval during
which this particular detection is observable lasts but a few minutes
which the technician used to verify that he was detecting SY and not
visible text. Ey the time ne calied in his two colleagues the reaction . -
had progressed to the voint thet only one of these technicians was ‘able
vo obgerve the SW, ihus the cperavor and one other technician saw tha

5. Before eiving an account ‘of the wrk done during the second
phase of the iivestization. (i.c,, after the letters were returned ‘to

megsage under these circumstances wuld have been almost impossible. : -
Tre only alternative available to the chemist, and the one he followed
in tris particular case, in to proceed with a series of chexical tests
applied directiy to the docuncnt under investigation. ‘These tests are —
appiied in sequmce, one afver the other, each requiring for itS exéecue.
tion that a portion of the pase be sacrificed. It 4s therefore impore ;
tant that those tests affording the greatest probability of developing
the SW be apolied first; thus if and when, a test is found capable of.
developing the ink, the retainder of the pace (i.e., the portion not.
affected by previous chenical apolications)} ig treated with it.
