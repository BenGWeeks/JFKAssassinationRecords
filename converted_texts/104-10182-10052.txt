‘forces’ and<turned over to the Congolese sovernment for use by the
Congolese Air Force There are some 150 cadets who have received some . so ta,
‘training and.are considered ready for advanced ‘training, but as of this
“PIERRCT has made extensive efforts
to obtain aid fron many. sources to train these cadets The AIRA re-
‘ports thut FIERECT his. requested did fron the Belgicns, the British,
United Faticns, and'asked the AIRA to request aid frou the French for
the Cangolese- Air Force, About 30-cadets ave in .treining in Turlisia at ©

‘the present' time. Cn-1] March the AIRA recommended aid be extended to

" the Congolese Air Force, but under the auspices of the United Fations,

2° PIERRCT also reported 11 March that he had 6 Moth and § Har-
vard T-6 aircreft being delivered'near the end of Karch, and. asked if
the United Nations. Cormund would allow them to enter the’Conge; He
even offered to let the planes remain under U.N, control, :

‘3. PIERROT is a mulatto ahd claims to have a white grandmother
in Dallas, Texas He was trained by the Belgians and cleims to have
flown C-47's end T-33 jet planes, though he has not been on flying sta-
tus since 1556 cue to goiter trouble At this time accurate bio data

completely devoted to PIERRCT, PIKRECT is p ious and at . ,
one point in the fall of 1960, he approached 7 ties with °
a plen to take over the government if they would help him His plan
was too transparent and weak for any serious consideration at that

" WIGOGJE was incensed ‘at the move of the GO in send @ parallel mission

‘to Europe and not informing him of it. “He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about
‘this other mission. WIZARD/2 apparently informed WIZARD/4 about ° . ;
“WIR0GUS's visit and since then, for a period of the last five days, — - .
WIZaRD/4 hes refused to ase or talk to WIKOGUE. : Lot ;

2. The GOC has also a ently proposed sending WIROGUE on an ..
intelligence gathering nission to Katanga. WILOGUE aaked if KUBARK were
' interested in this undertaking. We advised hin strongly arainat this .
. move and added we hud no interest whatsoever in the Project.

3. WILOGUE has also met the ODOATH representative and showed him
: _ the model submarine which was the subject of ACLA-630. The ODCATH

representative evincad interest in this model’ and through the ODUWIT
representative, whom WIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discussed. - we
‘the problem of purchasing planss for tho GOS, the ODOATH representative . ~ a
wes aware that WIHOCUS has an Ordre da Mission signed /by WIZARD/2 to ~~ : aan
travel to PAP.IMS. “He said for WI20GU8 to inform him when he was ready - :
to depart and he would arrange for WIROGUE to contgaot appropriate ODOATH

people in P3PRIKME to discuss tho modele .

: 4. WIROGUS -a:proached GUTHMAN on November 24 ‘and SALVACK on November
29 with a réquest whethér he might be of use to KUBARK either in Africa
or elsewhere in the worlds dnd that he would like to be taken’ back into
the fold. He is obviously concerned about his position in the GOC at this

_ time and feels with the diplozatic relations being established between
‘Belgium and the GOC that his position will become increasingly weeker. To
Teenphasize past assessments of dIRCSUE, he is far too disorganized an
individual to be an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where
action is required but detailed accurate Teporting is not. The station
agrees with an early statement made concerning WIHOGUS that he has a
peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and-
extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of

an action type.
