chatted with’ Vale

2. “As usual LOGINOY spent most of the time conversing
with undersigned provocating him on’a number- of issues. |The
undersigned. answered, making 2 tew similar coniments about the-
. Chinese’ Civil War.. “When LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undersigned.
felt it would be nice if the -Sovies. helpe the U. S. to ©
“bring péace to-that area so they could concentrate more-on .. a
the Chinese’ Communist danger... At one “point in the conversation ~ -
: undersigned jokingly- asked LOGINOV if there were Soviét
nationals in North- Vietnam. The latter said, "sure, we have:
many advisors there." The undersidnged said, “no, what he —
_Meant Was behind guns or.'in the seats of airplanes." ‘LOGINOV
“said absolutely. not. It also seems that LOGINOV has been —
keeping track of. the people’ he sees - undersigned talking with
at cocktail ‘parties. For’ example, LOGINOV was curious to ;
’ know if undersigned has seen “his Haitian: friend¢. " Undersigned
asked _whighione - the: black'one or the white one. LOGINOV
_ said. ‘the ubste one, referring to the Haitian Vice Corsgul whom
. undersigned occasionally talks to, Undersigned said he had
Seen the Haitian at:the Haitian, National Day about a month
ago but noted that. the ‘only Soviet -present at that party was -
. ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV.~ The latter, incidentally, corners of
“the: Haitians. anytime e. has. ° hance to, although he officially
‘ -poo- poos’ “the: Haitian regime. “LOG [NOV ‘once more asked under- be
“signed. when-he would come play tennis with him, (this 18 about
the ‘fourth or f1fth time); ‘Undersigned ‘told him he would do
so after he ‘gets ‘invited. by LOGINOV: as the latter has often
‘promised ‘todo. One of the topics that LOGINOV metitioned
. was fhe Protection Section of the Embassy. - "Protection against
- whom, '' he asked. The ‘undersigned gave him the usual’ lowdown:
~ on the number of \tourists to Mexico and their problems,
LOGINOV must -have been interested in the. section as he mentioned
that a U. S. Vice~Consul working in that section whom he had
met recently will be transferring to another post.

" PERSONALITY ‘ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This is a new, experimental version of the Persénality Assessment 2 es a
_ Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ Itl) which has been in =. 2 : ~

“use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires:
far less ‘essay-type reporting than the : ‘previous -form. = s

2. For. a riumber of years, , our 6perational psychologists have been de-
veloping a system for indirect assessment of target. personalities. The
* system: employs—in lieu of psychological tests and interviews—observations _
_ of appearance, manner, and’ style of behavior. .Such observations aré
“used as if they were items in a psychological: test, and like test items, are
*. weighted “and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the
. profile, operational psychologists describe the ‘target personality’s basic -
L, Gptitudes,. attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the astess- . ;
ment is to identify fea: ible means of influencing’ the target Person. ss 2 . al

3. Rel ability is vastly increased when two'or more observers complete -
this: questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact; .~ . . .
| ‘Itis:a ‘rare’ case, where contact is sufficient to complete i it fully, Youore

éncouraged to guess where. complete information is lacking. Mark such, _
items with a “G,” instead of the customary- check mark or “X.” ‘Thus, an
observer vith very limited” contact can be “expected to enter. more "G's"

‘than “X's.”

2. LIREALN-1's efforts against the local French target
“have produced somo notable results. First, through detailed
analysis of personalily and other data provided by LEREALM-1,
the Station selected an access agent to the official French
conmunity who was. later. successfully contacted and was offered
“a Gontract (see rererence C), fhe Statiou is already at work
on what appears to be -a good lead provided by tho access
agent spotted and doveloped by LIREALM~1. It should be
"emphasized that LIREALM=1 was in no way connected with the
approach made to the French access agent, The second item
. on.which LIREALM-1 has made progress has beon the dovoloprient
- ofa Méxican employeé-of“the French Enbassy who is used as a
: general: scourier inside ‘the’ Embassy, This. dev lopmont,. for -
“security reasons, has: been slow. LIREALN-1! s "line" has been .-
that a ‘person with "the ability". of the courier can-and -
_should expect a better. paying. job than the one -he currently
“holds. The courier ended up. taking that line as his own to
"protect" him (as he probably would have some trouble if the
: Embassy discovered ‘he was Idoking for another job). LIREALN-1.
started -mecting the Mexican coutier outside the Fronch Embassy.
a 7 This: gave. LIREALM-1 the opportunity to talk to his prospect: -
. at some length without attracting “the attention--of -the. members
‘of the Embassy. This..is as far as: the Station will allow -
LIREALN-1 to go in this éase, which -is. currently. boing. reviewed.
to decide who will continue the development of the - Embassy
courier and how, LIREALM-1 will not, in any case, have any
. connection with the. person selected for: this task. He will -
continue to maintain contact with the courtier ‘but will start
- to.sec him less often and will admit, in the end, that finding
a Job: for him turned out to be more difficult than expected.

Ben LIREALN-1 ‘néanwhile is continuing to cultivate a0

. “nutber, of selected members of the French Embassy and reports
. on their activities aS a matter of routine. He has also

maintained contact for some months with a Wealthy Mexican
businessman who is a good friend of DEVOSJOLY, ‘the ex-French  --
‘intelligence officer who provided the material for Leon uRIS'
- best seller Topaz. - -LIREALN-1, in fact, had established «=.
DEVOSJOLY's identity: as coauthor of the ‘pook long before this
came known publicly. He was Shown by DEVOSJOLY's friend a -
fe at the-latter's ‘house in México City full of documents
probably bélonging- to DEVOSJOLY. This information was reported
_to Headquarters via "special" channels.

pow @, LIREALM-1": s handling. of. LIRELIC-1 encompasses two
. " targets. By far the more important one is LIOGLE, -The goal
’ here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of
:: LIOGLE using. Several good contacts he has in this organization
as a stepping stone. Some steps have been taken in this
_ direction.” LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for
vassistance to current key LIOGLE personalities. He has also
‘ submitted his curriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job
in LIOGLE, . This has so far failed to produce any concrete
LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC~1 realizes, of course, that he is
of no value to LNHARP unless -he obtains a, job giving him access
to hard information on LIOGLE plans and activities. The
promise of a regular salary,’ as a matter of fact, is completely
dependent on LIRELIC-1's ability to penetrate LIOGLE. In an
effort to maintain interim contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1
liquidate some personal debts, the Station, via LIREALN-1,
made-him a loan of 3,000 pesos, Further details on the LIOGLE
“aspects of the LIRELIC- 1 operation will be covered in the
forthcoming LIOGLE/LIRELIC progress report. In addition to

1720 When the conversation ended, ROW TON \and
LIREALM-1 moved to the men’s room, where
LIREALY-1 was able to check the amount of
money. for him and sign the enclosed receipt.

_ 3. it will be noted from the above that the ROWTON/-
LIREALN-1 meeting with FRADYER was not planned in advance

(as pointed out in reference A), but was a hasty reconimendation

made to FRADYER by RO} ‘ON. and an equally hasty decision taken” |

. by: FRADYER on ‘the Spo ROWTON ‘and LIREALN-1 had, nict. previously

_ onl in ROWTON's home, ‘except on two. occasions when. -ROWTON , .
picked up LIRFALN-1_in lis car in tho Ciudad Deportes (near

the main Mexico City -bull ring) betiveon regular meetings’ to.
pass ‘him funds. “ROWTON-had never met with LIREALN-1 at

Sanborns or in any other. public place prior: to this, meeting.

4. LIREALM-1 also amplified his written report sub-
sequently in one. significant detail. In reference to the
remark of LOGINOV to the offect that he had'scen’ him with his
boss at Sanborns two Wednesdays previously when “you had a aan
drink in the bar and then talked to your boss," LIREALM-1 told
ROWTON on reflection that ‘LOGINOV had also stated that. "you~

were having & drink at the bar and a main came up to you and

~ ‘brought you to your -boss." This indicates that FRADYER was

meant ias the person described as LIREALN-1's boss.

- . 5s th regard to where and how. often ROWTON and:

. LIREALM-1 have had“operational incotings in the past, as.
requested in’ paragraph 3 of reference B, Station files show
that’ between. 20:October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met
with LIREALM-1 at ‘his hone ten times.’ Besides thesd meetings
with LIREALN-1 at his homé, ROWTON recalls only o
with LIREALM-1,-when he picked. up LIREALN-1 in his. car for brief
meetings to pass him funds, Since the LOGINOV/LIREALN-1 .

’ épisode, ROWTON has“ met. with LIREALN-1 at obscure. bars.to avoid
possible positive identification of ROWTON.in the even

: (LIREALM-1 was under surveillance. ‘LIREALMN-1 has passed his -.. |
reports. to ROWTON between their weokly meetings via a P.O.
letter drop taken’ out previously by LIREALM+1 under alias.

The only telephone contact that has existed between them has
been brief calls to ROWTON's home by LIREALM-1 alerting ROWTON,

.in double talk, that he has left an envelope at the drop,

: 6. With regard to the frequency of LIRFALN-1's meetings
with LOGINOY, mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B,
LIREALN-1's contact reports list only four meetings during

- the same period, all.of which occurred at the French Club, and

- one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at

. which very few words were exchanged. It is significant to note,

- however, that at the 12 November 1967 meeting,: while LIREALM-1
and LOGINOV were chatting in the showers after the match, the
latter "joked that (LIREALM-1)° should bring some of his friends

- from the Embassy." to join them in playing tennis. LOGINOV
added, also apparently with a slight: grin, "all of them. are
WOFIRM." FRADYER, to whom ‘this remark was promptly reported,
‘did not consider it €o have any special meaning since he knew
from personal and direct experience tha: LOGINOV is a born
provocateur who cannot resist needling people (Mexicans and
foreigners) with whom. he comes into contact. WOFIRM often
comes -up in LOGINOV conversations, not only with FRADYER, but
with persons of other nationalities. It was decided, however,
to again warn LIREALM-1 at his next meeting with ROWTON
on 16 November, when LIREALM-1 submitted his report, not to
involve himself with LOGINOV. LIREALM-1 assured ROWTON that

his continuing contacts with LOGINOV were at the latter's

initiative and that LIREALN-2 would not nake any attempt to

follow up or show any unu ual iuterest. ‘LIREALM-1 did not . .
report secing LOGINOV again until 13 January. 1968S (two months . 4 .
later), this tims, as usual, on the tennis court. : .

: ‘7, Headquarters will recall that the LIREALM-1 relation~
ship with tho Soviets dates back many months prior to the -
“date ROWTON took over his handling. The file reveals that
_LIREALM-1 first met, LOGINOV on 22 April 1967, and that at.
that ‘timo, LOGINOV proposed to LIREALM-1 that they meet - a .
regularly, every Wednesday, for tennis and 6ccasionally take nn cn
inva “movie with theix. wives, This leaves no doubt that the ‘
pace was. set by LOGINOV himself since he undoubtedly saw in
LIREALN-1 a potential target. The situation was further ~

_ complicated by the ‘character and modus operandi of LOGINOV,.--
- as'woll as the limitations of LIREALM-1's cover situation at

-the time. :

. 8. A principal dilemha facing the Cuse Officer with
regard to LIREALM-1's exposure to the Soviets has been his~
-regular attendancé at, the French Club, Since the French target
has been one of the main ones left to LIREALN-1 after the
- glimination of the Sovict, Indonesian, and UAR operations, it
‘Was: considered necessary for LIREALN-1 to continue his normal ..
contacts with the French. He could have dropped his menbership
‘involvement with the Soviets,
g-established pattern and.
It was

in the club to avoid further
. but this would have broken a-lon 2
» -deprived him of his»principal access at that time.
therefore ruled out. as counterproductive< -

. 9. .Subsequent developments appear to confirm the
Station's view that’ LOGINOV. based his provocative remark on
‘a hunch or, at most, on a strong suspicion concerning :
>-:) LIREALN-1. As mentioned in. paragraph 4 of reference B, such
prolonged social contact between an American and a Soviet
"is almost inevitably construed on both sides to have intel-—
: _ _“Ligence, connotations ."~ The Station wishes to emphasize, :
/ ~ however, that, whatever suspicions were aroused in the mind. 7...
» . of LOGINOV concerning LIREALM-1 were already generated months,
~ before he joined the, PBRUMEN Section, in late October 1967. .

co 10: In conclusion, the Station feels that nothing has

of a safehouse. All meetings between the undersigned and
_ LIREALM-1 have since been held under’the most secure con-
ditions on’ the edge of.'the: Federal District and, in one éase,
-beyond. While this does not make’ this decision any ‘wiser, he
also wants “to emphasize the fact that ‘it was made on the spur |
of ‘the moment, >to quote tha old ‘cliche, because the undersigned
“felt sorry" for’ LIREALM-1 because of the latter's financial
_ difficulties with the Station over his last accounting. The
. undersigned unwisely put LIREALN-1's morale for a brief moment
. “over basic security considerations. He is not in the habit *
~ of doing this as a matter of-course. The day before his next
scheduled tennis meeting with LIREALN-1 the following Wednesday,
-LOGINOV’ calied LIREALN-1 and asked to be excused as his leg °
had worsoned. ‘The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his
regular tennis game with LIREALM-1 but made no mention of
his previous conversation with him two weeks before. The
undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until
he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association
functions. Because of the visits of Soviet athletes and
artists which kept LOGINOV busy, however, this meeting did not
materialize until 28 March. Although the undersigned and
LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more than two hours
-on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Fair, LOGINOV
never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting. He has
never brought LIREALM-l's name to the attention of the

The LNPURE officer also informed..the. case officer that Subject had -
proviously mentioned that he had once been “approached” to supply
information on Soviet travelers ona regular basis and had refused
to do 80, Subject evidently did ‘not. spocifically say that he had
_beon approached by -WOFACT,. but this ¢zs clearly the implication. | :
“Subject told the LNPURE officer that he -was-willing to: sup’ iy: informa~

'. gtated that-he wag not intorested in working for the Station on a "|

‘permanent, "agent" basis, in: meeting under clandestine circumstances,

explained, because he -believed basically what we did about current: .

.. owe . _ world problens and, after all,. had Lived. in WOLADY for many years and
a ae |” regarded it as his “second home". On. th sis of this interview.

y a8 a somewhat disingenuous egoist who, despite a genuine sympathy
‘or WOLADY, regardod his coo eration with: the Station. primarily as a
méang of insuring his. business contacts with LNPURE and as sonething .
whith bad to be k pt ‘to a tihinum lest it “limit his independénce or:
detract him in any’way from his business and personal interests.
This impression sorved ag. the basis for the evaluation of Subject

‘contained in-Reference A. . _

ys

ooo pe Ba Thee se officer's impression of Subject changed considerably.
= rn ie with the next meeting, which was held on 18 October. At this. meeting,
: . oe | -the case officer gave Subject ‘a defensive briefing for his. trip: and. .- |-
‘|~ .went over general reporting re iirenents. ‘Subject surprised the’ case’

aa i officer with his friendliness and ‘cooperativeness, and went to great |
pains to explain that he wes more than willing to cooperate with the
‘Station as long as he d not -become so, deeply involved in ,intelligenc
‘work that his business or personal life was adversely affected.. The

~ * ease officer was impressed’ by Subject's apparent’ sincerity and got
‘the. definite impression that ever sinée receiving the Intourist. invita
tion, Subject hid been fearful he was again going to be asked to
accept a double agent role which, if it materialized, would: require —.
him to become far nore déeply involved in intelligence work then he ~
ished, Sensing both Subject's‘relief at not being asked to. under-
‘ake, a more demanding assigament and his concern to make it clear that
ma his heart.was nevertheless in the right place, the case officer used
. +: 4. the opportunity to again pose the question of whether Subject would
be willing to report on a routine basis.on persons -who booked travel
‘ H through his agency to the USSR, The case officer told Subject that
_ |.) _.thiga information could be forwarded to the Station through the LNPURE
. -|° “officer and assured ‘him that his cooperation in supplying such infor-
mation would not involve him in a series of escalating intelligence
assignments. Evidently satisfied that his role would remain a limited
_one, Subject agreed to report the desired information on a regular
‘basis. Moreover, he volunteered to check with other travel agencies
a in order to fulfill specific requirements for information on travelers

Subject, their relationship during.the past -year-has“been ‘atrictly of ©

there. had -not been any signs of action, BESABER was’ dustructed :
to try to. get. in touch with LOGINOV regarding the purchase of
vodka (for Christmas). ‘When ‘Christsas passed without: any ‘luck |
in contacting LOGINOV pincer was. extremely busy during this’

“thi ivity wit

8. One further matter for the record; BESABER was first “|
_ introduced to LOGINOV: by BEWKEP. They again were together at H
_ the Polish Babagsy on 4 “October” 1966. Although BESABER has,
“tot told BEWSEP of his. meet with LOGINOV on 13 January it is
\ only because -BESABER has not.seen BEWEEP gince before Christmas. :
-BESABER has -been” instructed to be’ perfectly open with BEWERP |
‘

about, having seen LOGINOV and in fact it may turn out that
LOGINOV and BEWEEP will !visit BESABER together. (LOGINOV
referred to the possibility in his 13 January reet with BESABER).
