WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS INVOLVED

. ‘

1. The information provided below is taken from a Santo
Domingo Station liaison report transmitted to Headquarters under
HDCA-11074, dated 29 November 1976. The information dated 29
August 1976 was received by the liaison service from one of its
agents assigned to Miami, Florida. It is being sent to you for
information only. All information below was reportedly stated
in testimony at the trial of the Cuban terrorist Rolando Otero
in Jacksonville, Florida, and Antonio Gonzaléz had obtained -
immunity from prosecution. The declarations ‘he ‘made were cor-
roborated by Cubans Ciro Orizondo and Manuel Revuelta, former.
cohrades of Otero in the Frente” de Liberacion Nacional Cubano

(FLNC).

2. According to Antonio Gonzalez, there have to be in
Miami up to $00 pro-Castro agents operating; that in a supposed -
plot to kill Fidel Castro in Venezuela, there had been with him
and Rolando Otero, a Cuban named Ricardo Morales and infiltrating
into the affair, he tried to frustrate the plan. Gonzalez also —
said that Morales, supposedly worked for the "CIAin the Congo"
and actually is an agent of the Government of Venezuela, used ~ po
“to- investigate those Cubans who enter and exit from Venezuela. | |
Gonzalez also sdid that in reality, Morales is a Castro: agent.
