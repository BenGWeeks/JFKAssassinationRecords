THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I, 27 October 1966

L. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for °
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories..Only a rela-_
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

201 SYSTEM |

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie, 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as s identifying file number for reporting on that
individual. .

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 901 ¢ opening form (Form
“831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i ie, per-

“e@ The Master 201 Record: ‘a machine record generated by the be oa of 7
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be mov: ed up and the ref.
erence consolidated.

e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OL codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or .
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be’ established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO throvgh the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may y be assigned two OI codes. An OI coder may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

' The. 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of, 201

. de-has been-opened. for the
ecurity ‘service of a certain ¢ eounty a listing may ‘be compiled of. all ‘members ~
of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: _ produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of Personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER , ‘
a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the eccasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 20] dossiers may be ~
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of Jocal interest to a field station or Headquarters desk

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO |

records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings en certain categories of persons whose

‘names appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are. listed in Attachment 2. 201

dossiers should be opened in the following categories: . cet

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be ‘opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

"tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

' (3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats, of ‘other than
; denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel,

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

or more documents (seéDOL 70-20). -

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from ISN/
ISR (opened only by TP/RMS). : .

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filing 0 out - and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 20] personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201. file by writing 201- in the Head- .

quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after’ the
subject's name in the body of the-dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings throygh receipt of the field master 201 record.

a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk olficer, It requires _
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather. than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: ;

(1) Duplicate material, i.e., exact copy(s) of a document. ;
(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
_ theopening. . ct
: -(3) All abstract slips, a
' (4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report...

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or

Record copy-doeuments which’ only, repeat’ ‘substantive informat
ed. in-“other.. documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to. be retained in a 201 1 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention -
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained -
in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a
cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location
of the TS document. -

(9) Deferred documents (see 5b(2) ).

b. Maintenance Procedures

(1) All material in a 201 dossier will be filed in document date order.

be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards
should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201. :

(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff
employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to _
‘the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be
closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it.

(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true
name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name.

. i) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
. has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining i information classified
to that 201. by the Analysis Section (P/AN). ees

(1) Any document with predécesse organization. cover. sheet or an:
OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from thd Archives and
Disposition Section » ORIARD) must be retumed to IP/ARD for processing
to the 201. . :

remaining in a 20} dossier being retired to Central Files, place that document
in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17). Any RYBAT, P&L,
or KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope will
automatically be handled as desensitized. A black-taped envelope may con- .”
tain only one document and must be filed in chronological order within the
file. If there are numerous documents of this type the desk officer may black-
tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).
