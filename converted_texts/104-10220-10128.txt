COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES ~
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

1, A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his
use as a penetration of Vonozuclan General Directorate of
Police. Cancellation was roquested in February 1968 because
of indications that Subject wag involved in "clandestine sabotage
activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi- ‘|
ties to CIA, Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile".
In the ensuing months Bubjoct was described as "an extremely
valuable penetration” because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
given & polygraph oxamination to clear up questions about pos-
Bible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-
tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no
information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes,
Request for POA was again requested on 7 September 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 October duc to Subject being

an ‘agent of a forcign power.”

2. Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc, Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
a very pro-U.S, attitudo. Subject was again polygraphed on
29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
CI/OA folder), His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.S, Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms

dealings, etc.

MEMORANDUM FORt Director of Training of
Attention: Chief, Covert Training OS/TR ao
P _
SUBJECT 1 Covert Training Reuirement for Station # ae"
Caracas, Project CIYLUTE p +
REFERENCE 1 CSI No. 255 ,

1. With regard to previous discussions between WH/3/
Venezuela and Chief, Covert Training granch, it is hereby
requested that two instructors be assigned on TLY status to
Station Caracas for the purpose of corducting operational train-
ing for selected members of the Directorate General of Police
(DIGEPOL) and the Central Documeritation Service (SDC). Names
of the training candidates are included on a separate sheet
attached to this memorandum.

eee . 2. This training program has reen initiated at the direct
request of senior Venezuelan liaison officers associated with

. Station Caracas. A genera), description of the situation, cub-
ject matter and identification of pozzible problem arcas has
boen forwardéd to you in the form of H/CA-16550, 9 May 1969,

3. Project CIFLUTE, under which this training will be
conducted, was approved: on 8 March 19623 and covers all liaison
conducted by Station Caracas with the Yenezuclan security

services.

4. In thie training program, we hope to attain several
objectives, First, through training selected members of
DIGEVOL and SDC we wish to present scurd operational methods
and techniques which will impress the trainees and serve as a
guide to them in ampcoving their operations, Secondly, it is
desired to improve Station Curacas’ liegison relationship with
these services by presenting a highly professional training
program. Third, we hope that through this good will, the Station
will be able to develop potential unilateral agent recrults
who will become perietrations of the Venezuclan services.

5. All of the trainea candidates (ace attached list) are
Inembers of DIGEPOL and SDC, The first four individuals listed
have extensive intelligence backgrourds end are experienced

we

operations personnel, The remaining six trainees may be

ansumed to have moderate expertence - more in the field of law
enforcement and police investigations rather than intelligence
operations, 201 files aro available at the desk on each indivia

' dual and we will make these filos available to the anstructors

to give them an idea of oach individuals background.

6. Trainees will be available on a full time basis. A
secure building haa been obtained by the liaison services for
exclusive use by instructors during the training cycle. Train=

ing will have to be conducted in Spanish.

7. Although evaluations on all traineca are desired, the
last six individuals listed will require more attention since
our relationship with these men is new and less is known about
them. Station Caracas will provide guidance in this area. An
additional point of interest would be any individual among this

group who might have potential as an instructor.

8. Follow-up training and/or technical training will be
based on instructor and Station recommendations, At this time
we havo no information on what, if any, technical skills the

trainees have.

S September 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OA
SUBJECT a AMCLEVE-15 (201-300985) ~ .

1. Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuéla,
is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuelan General
Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, asnaller,
somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested
on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above.
On 1 February 1967, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA
request. because. of indications that Subject was involved in
clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that
he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL.
Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject. as a "hostile".
The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with
Subject as a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL
and the Special Group but that.no requirements were to be
levied on him. The Station was advised that they could make
spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/oPSs
co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.

2. The Station acknowl edyed their instructions but
demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of AMCLEVE-15'a
activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are
often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con-
trol and who seldom disclose the complete rango of their
activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they
wece interested in Subject because of his position as a “trusted
confidant" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.

3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe
Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the
intelligence information and operational reports he furnished.
For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan
military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

as part of an infiltration scheme, He has reported such
operational information as a description of the capabilities,
layout and equipment of DIGEPOL tclephone tap operations.
Included in this information was his report that, at least on
paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for tap operations. He

has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organizations with Which he is associated. At the same time

the Station had an independent report that Subject was tnvolved.
in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty
hypodermic necdles". To avoid exposing the source of their
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve-
ment in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this

“involvement with him. .°

4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that
they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of v

engaging in independent Cuban exile activity “without informing .
his Case

ficer, The “Station also requested a polygraph exam-
‘Or Subjett.

ination

5.- Subject was-given a polygraph examination to resolve
specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban
{intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM and ether questions
involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject'a
responses, deecribed as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv-
ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer,Lefty Rosenthal,
did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, ",..In fairness
to Subject this sensitivity £8 believed generated by genuine un-
Certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile

arms supplies, "

6. Station Caracas has requested that they be allcwed to
cease treating AMCLEVE-1l5 as a “hostile” and that he be pro-
cessed for POA/OA to permit more effective utilization of this
well placed penetration agent. Wi Division Prdpmpas the ; Station's

WH COMMENT: *COS, Minit and Eraste Fernandez Betancourt, £oF DC/Digepol met
to discuss colubératien between Station and Digepol. Not
clear if Fernandez to be new Chief. While F has bad rep not
clear why. Fernandez was cooperative with Station previous
time no clear indications he enriched himself by accepting .
vibes from left. Station would work slowly until full :
assessment acquired. Asked WAVE to work closely with .
AMCLEVE-15 during Fernendez stay in Miami to collect info on
‘ latter.
