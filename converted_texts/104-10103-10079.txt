the reorientation of the current effort into » long tera

I, ASSUMPTIONS:

De The Castro-communist regine will remain in power for

ithe indefinite future with its security and control apparatus
relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, ‘but of ‘making operational

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in removing the offensive weppons: trom Cube mey

indication that the: control of the Castro-comnunist regine over

9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey
has been made world-wide of all Communist Party

penetration operations and wherever any such penetration

can be directed ogainst Cuba either by dispatching the

sgent to Cuba or by pointing the agent agsinst Cubsrn
targets, this will be done, except in those cases wheres
such action would result in unneceptablgprejudice te
the operations in the srex where the ngent is now based.
It is believed that the most lucrative field for the
redirection of such operations to the Cuban target will
be Latin America where there sre 65 penetrations of
various communist parties. Of this 65, the survey

we have conducted indicates that 23 have some direct

pertinent access to Cuban targets. Ail of these 22 wil!

be directed against these targets unless in uny case

OF gxamined to see if they can be diverted to Cuban trrgets.

/As feealhle, we will act to mount ss much ef this effort es

possible from areas outside the continental United States, end
particularly fron Latin America. If Higher Authority decides

“on | a “Track Two" concept. or on. any, ‘pimilar concept which

“contemplates heavy uncontrolled and only generally directad

that: efforts should be mado to: transfer as much as possible

for the most intensive feasible collection of intelligence,
