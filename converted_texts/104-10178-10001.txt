MEMORANDUM FOR: Alien Affairs Officer,
- OPS/LSN

SUBJECT “ : Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles

1. On 30 June 1974 Luis Clemente POSADA's employment
with the Agency was terminated by mutual consent. At that
time he was establishing a private investigative agency from
which he expected to earn his livelihood, The Immigration
and Naturalization Service file on POSADA, thorofore, may
now be decontrolled. As of 27 January 1975, POSADA is still

’ located in Caracas, Venezuela.

2. On 12 June 1974 Caracas Station advised that POSADA
had beon informed of and fully understands the effect that
termination of his Agency employment will have upon his
resident alien status and eligibility for U.S. citizenship.
We have not yet received termination records on POSADA,
probably because the Station is still meeting with him
regarding settlement of his outstanding U.S. tax liabilities.

SOURCE INFORMATION

(4) " WKSCARLET-3. WKSCARLIT-3 was granted a POA effective
17 January 1972 and an OA effective 17 July 1972, He was first
nn Bn ca ater a ee eRRenEnnenEne —— .
brought to the attention of the Station by WH/Miami, It is difficult
to tell from our files exactly when contact was initiated, but as
early as 1965, Subject was being used by BKHERALD, WKSCARLET-3 Ls
‘currently in the process of establishing a private investigative
company in Caracas. From.January throuch “arch 1974, when the new
government took over and KSCARLET-3 was asked to leave his job,
he was the Chief of Gu Ue of Seeusiru of WKSCARLET, and reported on all
aspects, operations, ete. of that unit. He is now in the process
of being terninated, effective 30 June 1974, by his case officer,
BACHIUBER, due to his lack of access and high profile. WKSCARLFT-3
currently receives compensation in the arount of Bs2,000 per month,
Subject was last successfully piven an SCSKIRL on 8 May 1973. Since
March 1974, his profile has been relatively high. There have been
two articles in the local press naming him as a BKHERALD agent.
Since those two articles, none have appeared; however, he has several
high powered nersonal enenies in the current government and could
come under political attack at any time. The Station does not feel
that WKSCARLET-3 presents or will present a security threat. le
has been well treated during his Jong relationship with BKHERALD
which he realizes and is thankful for. Meetings to carry out the
termination are being conducted with strict regard for security.
A safchouse used for part of the period (S/H 48) and costing about
$950, was terminated in March 1974. The only special commitment
with WKSCARLET-3 is a termination Payment of Bs6,000,

times by the WOOUAL Arny.

ry

\

On 8 May 1973, in IDEN C, Subfect was again SGSWIRLed at the

received money or been involved fn the sale, ourchase, or
smuggling of drugs. :

"4 that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has never
been asked to participate in the illecal drug traffic.

DETAILS:

Curing the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that he personally
has suoked martjuana on three or four occastons and-he has sniffed
cocaine on approximately five occasions in the oast ten years. Sub-
Ject asserted that’ on. each occasion, he was attending soctal gatherings
with KSTONE friends andhe felt socially comelled to indulge in
order to please the other partictpants. He estimated that he knows
approximately thirty-five people who use cocaine er marijuana. Subject
asserted that his last use of cocaine was last ronth when he visited
WODUAL. SGSWIRL supported Subject's claim that his personal use of
drugs has not been more extensive.

during the pre-test discussion, Subject asserted that he was not
acquainted with anyone who he knew for certain was involved in drug
trafficking. Subject did list the following IDENS when asked {f he
knew enyone who he “suspected” was involved tn traff¥cking drugs:
Subject asserted that his suspicions
were based on rumor and these people have never talked to him about
{llega} drugs. After recording reactions to the test question, “Are

" you cencealing the identity of anyone who you knaw 1$ involved in the

Sale or smuggling of drugs?” (Ans. ¥o), Subject acknowledged that his
concern for the question was due to the fact that he more than merely
“suspected® IDEN D was involved and he was “90% certain,”

Ouring the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that in 1954 or
1955, while fn KMSTONE, he and a friend sold a fon-dangerous drug to
a buyer who believed it to be cocaine. Subject asserted that he made
$25.03 from this transaction. Also, while in KMSTONE at the same

Oppuysition insisted that mrohines had to be used in the next elections bacause the
laws spactfied this. Tha Soofal Christian Party [COPEI], the Demoaratia National
Proat [PKD} aid an indepandent party ware opposed to the purchase because it meant a
Aisbursanant of millions of bolivares, Subsequently the matter was submitted to a

vota and the opposition parties won,

PLMUABYSS/Forkard ing of BXDD Pocument’s Regarding Luis POSADA
action RtouiRID- ae

Reference: CARACAS-21539

1. Forwarded herewith are two BXDD ROIs and one telegram
regarding Luis POSADA. The first ROTI Frepared’ by S/A Jose Marin
and dated.6 February 1973 is based on a debricfing of a BNDD
source who identifies POSADA aka "Rambi" as being a source of
supply for narcotics in Venezucla. The Cl also Claims that :
POSADA, along with Jose Gomez and Uumberto TRUFVA, have been
involved in other illegal activity such as dealing in stolen mer-
Chandise, counterfeit money, and contraband.

2. The other ROI, prepared by S/A Charles R. Schaming and
dated 13 March 1973, concerns a debricfing of a source who does
not believe that POSADA is involved in narcotics,

3. The third document is BNDD Headquarters telegram 1846
of 23 March 1973 (repeated from Miami BNOD) concerning the
debriefing of Jose GOMEZ, the BNDD CI who went seur. GOMEZ?
debricfing adds little and in the opinion of the Station and BNDD
Caracas, GOMEZ is either. lying and/or not telling the whole truth,
GOMLZ lists a number of names of persons he claims to have met
while in Caracas which we do not consider worth a follow up
except that of Colonel Freddic BALBOA. RALROA may possibly be
the unidentified police/security official so frequently seen with

GOMEZ et al. ~
