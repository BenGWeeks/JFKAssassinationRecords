\ The 201 system oi Nd for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations ectorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information-about them and for
producing lisits of 20] personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are: .

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234587, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying fil ber for reporting on that
individual. QQ \ :

e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in
sonality records in the 201 system to reco ok
with organizations or activities of opest\

jon with the 201 per-
tation of an individual
Nierest. OL codes cover intelli-
ethér s' agent, or known or

suspect, as well as activities, i aks) two categories of OL
codes for use by compo: On .
_ (1) general OT. WY
(2) OI codes assigned
or other specific organizatio . .
A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer. _ .

%

A 20] personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
‘when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 83] amendment. . .

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OF code has been opened for the
Security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members

of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
