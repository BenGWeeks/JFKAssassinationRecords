SUING BRK s@ryeant to : seant or colonel to colonel whether the matter

itgreed to let me know during the forthcoming week, ?

2. In checking this morning I find that Mr, Sidel-is out on leave
and. going into tralning for at least the next week: In asking how to wet
in touch with Mr, Sidel, eventually Mrs. Sui-s = cme on the Hne,

She advised that nothing new was in the record and there was no info

on the verification of the military service and wished to assure me that
just because someone Went on leave or wag out that a case was not dropped,

T asked then If Any affort has:been made to contict MMPD. She said the

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeremy K. BENADU¥

During the past three months I have kad the opportunity
to work with and direct the activities of Jeremy K. BENADUM.
Within a few months he will be retired from further service
and it is appropriate now to review his past porformance ~
and presont status in ordor, that this remain a permanent

Part of his record.

BENADUM, during: tho past ten years, Has performed as
tho outside case officer for the LITEMPO Project, ile was

pressod into service after resigning his position with

LNERGO, for whom he worked for ao period ct twerly years.
Mis. primary value to the.Station, at that tine, was his

uccess tu persons of all-levols within the Mezicin Covernment

and especially the Mexican Security Service. On further
investigation it became clear it was hig cluse personal and
official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offsred him this
access across the board. Gradually over the geurs he
devoltoped a similar relationship with LITMéH0-12, LITEMPO-4

and others.

: Wis past evaluations are still valid, huwsver, during
the past three months he has gradually been phased out of
liaison contacts and has been used principally to assist the
Station in its orderly liaison transition. He is currently
in touch with two liaigon types officially but oceusionally
soos others on a purely social basis.

Although his retirement is not voluntary, hie hns good-
naturedly assisted the Station in this very eensitive and
delicate changeover. Ne will remain in Mexico after hia
retirement and has offered his assistance if needed. He’
presonts no overriding handling problem, reports promptly and
does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings. :

capability {a -in the tfeld of collection of FI intelligence and
operational support, the latter being his most outstanding area of
contribution to Station objectives, He would also be capable of
vunning CI operations, His knowledge of CA type work, however,
cannot be assessed at Headquarters,

Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties,
Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years,
he is psychologically prepared for his dual role in intelligence
operations and is well qualified to operate without strong Station

support,

Headquarters is not in a position to comment on the timeli~
ness or quality of his operational reperting, but no defects in this
brought to the attention

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNKSS R&KPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeromy K. RENADUM

During the past threo months I have had the opportunity
to work with and direct the activities of Jeremy K. BENADUK.
Within a few months he will be retired from further service
and .it is appropriate now to review his past performance

.and present status in order that this remain a permanent

Part of his record.
BENADUM, during the past ton yours, has performed as

‘the outeide cass officer for the LITEMPO Project. Ho was

pressed into service after rosigning his position with
LNGRGO, for whoe he worked for a period of twenty years.

- Hig primary valusa to thé Station, at that timo, was his

access to persons of all-levels within the Hexican Government

“and especially the Mexican Security Services. On further

invastigation 1t bocame clear it waa his close personal. and
official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offered him this
access across the board. Gradually over the years ho

developed a similar relationship with LITEMPO-12, LITEMPO-4

and othera,

His past evaluations are still valid, however, during
tho past three sontho he has gradually been phased out of
liaison contacta and has been used principally to assist the
Station in its orderly liginon transition. He 1s currontly
in touch with tve liaison types officially but occasionally
sees Others on a purely social basis.

Although his retirement is not voluntary, hoe has good-
naturedly assisted tho Station in thia very saenaitive and
delicate changsover. ie will remain in Mexico after his
retirement and haa offered hie assistance if neoded. He
Presgonta no overriding handiing problea, reports promptly and
does a good job in eubattting his monthly accountings.

1, Reference asked Headquarters guidance in determining ~ \
. possible adjustment in the Quarters ANowance for Jeremy K.

1964 for $50, 200 and cost of utilities average $48 monthly,

at the rate of $4, 128. 96 per annum. 4

: --Reference forwarded a list of BENADUM's estimates
of utilities costs and a LNPURE memo on personally owned quarters.

2, The formula described in Para 3 of the LNPURE memo \
has been used in prior cases and is that which Js also used by the
Allowance Committee. Based on this formula, 10% of $50, 200
(original purchase price) plus $1, 176 (yearly utllities), total $6, 196, 1
The amount granted BENADUM would pregumably be the maximum :
unless the Station had determined a lesser rate was applicable due
to cover or operational reasons,

3. Using the effective date (5 October 1969).of the current
Quarters ANowance rate $4, 700 (34, 160 plus $600 for dependents)

PERSONALLY-OWNED QUARTERS

Because of the number of tnquires received regarding personally=
owned quarters, the following memorandum which has been sent to
a number of posts may be useful as a guide to our policy on the
subject:

. : When an employee occupies personally owned quarters his SF-1190
a4 should show in Section 21 (5) the initial purchase price as
. shown by the deed, Section 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show
i annual rates for utilities as authorized by Section 132.5 of
° the Standardized kegulations (Government Civilians, Foreign
‘ Areas), ‘These are the only ‘items of cost to be considered,

: When ‘the quarters ‘allowance system provided for reimbursement

A - 2. for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum, the reyulations
\ : provided that the allowance for personally owned quarters should
yo not exceed 10 percent of the purchase price, converted to dollars

Hl at the exchange rate available at the time of purchase, plus allow-
: ‘able utilities, The 10 percent of purchase price was ample to
‘take care of taxes, depreciation; repairs, interest ou investment,
and amortization of the costs within’a reasonable period of time

by U; S. standards, Only light, fuel, and water could be added

in arriving at the allowance. .

Under the current quarters allowance system, it is expected that

the flat rate will be paid unless the authorizing officer believes
it necessary to-reduce the payment under Section 134.2 of the
Standardized Regulations, The employee in personally owned

quarters would be treated the same as any other (except that

he cannot recelve advance payment of quarters allowances under
Section 113 of the Standardized Regulations). This makes
unneccessary.a special rate for personally owned quarters, The
requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro-

vide- the authorizing officer additional information to be considered,
together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in deciding
whether reduction of the allowance is necessary and, it so, how
‘much, Only the utilities costs are to be vonsidered in addition
to the purchase price except in those rare instances’ where land
rent ts involved, Because of varying conditions between posts

and individuals, {t was not considered advisable to specify any
certain percentage of the purciiase price that should be considered,

oo

In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing
officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly
from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally
owned quarters should be treated any differently than the employce
in rented quarters and receiving the flat rate allowance,

3. BENADUU was able to ertablish a system whereby persons
ef A{ntsrest to FOrIRH residing in PURUKEN may obtain Mexican ontry
.visas- without tho long dolay usually required.

4. BENADUM writes well and has improved considerably in
providing information bo obtains from his contacts in written. fora,
Usually, the reports. he submits need little editing in order to be \
processed for dissemination. .

5. This Officer speaks fluent Spanish which enables him to
.communicate with tho persons with wham he meets in a free and easy
manner, This ability certainly has assisted BENADUH in establishing ,
the rapport and canfidence so necessary in working with Latins,- \
especially those ‘working for the host government. .

- 6. BENADUM presents no overriding handling problems for hia

Station Case Officer. He is willing to work long hours, reports

promptly. and does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.

Based upon the Regular Fitness Report systen, this Officer could be
rated as STRONG in judging his performance,

7.  BENADUM is the only other Station Officer besides the Cos

_ who has good and ready access to various personages within tho |
Mexican Government. With the departure of Willard C. CURTIS, the
value of BENADUY to the Station should not be underestimated, !

al April, 1969

SUBJECT: Involuntary Retirement

. 1. A desk officer from Headquarters visited the uéxloo
Le City Stetion during mid-November, 1958, While here, the visiting
- officer talked with the writer for &pproximably one hour regarding
' the operation of the Litempo projeot and writer's plans for the
‘future. The following points Were discussed:

oo (a) The fact that the project was cons fdored to be an
important and successfuh one, . .

: oo (b) Writer was specifically asked if he had any plang
for an early retirement. writer replied in the negative. The
visiting offiner indicated complete satisfaction with writer's
_ desire to continue in the sarvice, and noted that 1t would de
‘particularly important in View of the upooming change of Nexican
administrations in December, 1979, and tne necessity of kesping
the projeot functioning at its current level of offeativensss,

: (oe) When the visiting officer asked whether the writer
head ever visited Headquarters during his career with the service,
and found that he had not done 30, the officer asked whether ;
weiter could arrange to visit. Headquarters for a week or ten days
during hia next home leave, which would take pleoe in August, 1969,
Writer indtosted that he would be most pleased to do 80s :

26 Based on the foregoing, writer made Plans to provead to
the United States on home leave tn early August, 1969, to return
in mid-September, 1969. Since suoh matters cannot be handled on
short notice, writer has already ranted a house in San Franaisoo,

California for the period in question,

3e This 1s where matters atood, when, on 7 April, lest,
writer was sdyvised that he would be retired, effective 30 June,
1969, in aecortance with various ohanges of polloy. He gas also
asked to confirm in writing that ho is in accord with the plan.
to place him on retired status as of 3G June, next, ;

ke While the roasoning behtnd what appears to be a oemplete
roversal of poliey, viaeaevis the writer, may be orystal olear te

loas to understand, fF

appears..to him to be arbitrary, short-sighted and trraticral, would
Te -- bo completely out of charaoter.-for @ person-who has spent. almost . _
_ thirty years in the intelligenoe field, and has a justifiable pride
in his status as.a professional intelligence officer, As a
cc——— professional, writer also realizes when the handwriting, novever
illegible.it might be, 1s on the wall, and, that if the desision
. has already been mde to retire him involuntarily, then retired he
. will be --= involuntarily, Little as it may matter, writer desires
os +, to emphasise that nothing in thio memorandum should be construed
yo to indieate writer's personal accord or approval,

- 5, Acoording to writer's records, as of 30 June, next,
he will have completed ths following government service:

taken home leave in 1942, 1964 and 1966, in acoordanas with
regulationa, In lina vito whdt appaared to be Agensy policy as
of November, 1963, writer has made plans for home leave from
+ 9 August to 16 Septesder, 1969. Writer feels. moat strongly that = =

government expense, - : .

Hi . q Future of crojects Writer would de less than candid

i transition, with a aonoomitant loss of effeativenees, Evon though
‘he 19 being retired, writer is still interested in preserving
(the results of his work in Méxioo, whioh writer regards aa being

‘of continuing importanes to our country,

! 8, In conclusion, epitar wishes to atate that he has

thoroughly enjoyed his assootation with the Agenoy during the

past nine years, and ts proud of his part in the aoccmpolishmenta

of the México City Station, Owing to the nature of ariter's 5
- position, his peraonal contacts have been largely limited to

the personnel of the Station here, The writer haa tne highest
professional and personal regard for the Chief of Station, with

whom he has been privileged to serve, ag wal} as the nignly

oompetent ease officers who havo worked with writer on tne projoate

It is a scureo of great satisfaction and pride to the
writer to have known and worked with a truly great American,
Sr. Allon W. Dulles, whom the "San Franelsco Chronicle” (generally
a hostile oritio of the Agenoy) described posthumously as
*...Tha most creative, powerful and eminent U.S. intelligence
officer of modern times", And, &8 one's career comes to a olose,
the worda of President Nixon, in desoribing Hr. Dulles? grant”
eontribution to his country, have a very rartioular sipniticance:
“.eoIn the nature of his task, his achievements were kmosn to

of Career Agent Jereny KR. BENADUM

1, Durdag the recent audit af wi Vivision, we noted
that, since October 1961, Career Agent Jeremy K. UENALUN
bas not submitted cover incom: reperts. These reports are
reguired evary 34x sonths by HENADUM'a contract. Office’
of @inance perscnnel informed us that, aince hin payroll
file does not indicate that he is under a covee activity,
they do not expect these reporta tu be submitted and there-
fore have not requested thea, Nowever, operational files
in WH Division Mexico Branch indicate that BrNADUM owns
his own business in Mexico City, ia a member of the Board
of Directors of another business, and spends a portlen of
his duty hours oa these buslhesses. Therefore, it appears
that BENACUM may be receiving cover income which should be
refunded in accordance with hia contract. Inu addition, the
question arises ag to whether ACNIDUM's contract ahould
contain the provision (similar to Douglas J. FREAPANE'S
contract) that he can retain only the first $2,¢0l a year
company profits as provided dn FN 2u-32, :

1. The Station waa surprised to receive the reference, which
stated that HEHADUM'a Life insurance appLization lind not been received
in Finance Divislon an of 15 ee LG, Recently we reeelved |
dated Lh June 1962, which requested that the Station collect frum HENADUM

1 the premluns for his life insurance, and no mention was made of payroll
deductions we had requested in T-2800. Therefure, the Statlon col+
iected the sum of $72.00 from B DUM in paysent of 6 months premiums.

: This payment was forwarded to Neadquartora under HMM-T-25992.

2. No action will be taken by he Station to change BENADUM's
‘fleld allotment until notiCleation is received from Headquarters. It
,would appear that the eacient means of now adjusting his pay account
‘would be to refund the pre-pald premligas and bepyin paywwll. deductions
‘for the life Lneurance. .
