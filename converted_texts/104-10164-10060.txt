collaboration, Precisely this week the Public Scourity Ministry ordered James Williamson .
to leave the country, As we all know, Williamson is the CIA's chief in Costa Rica. During

the activities of the CIA, the Costa Rica Libre Moverent and. other groups: Erving ‘to overs
throw the goverment in pover at the time, .

. We expect Charpentier and yaoso te explain to the deputies ani the nation vhat is really —
happening in Guatemala and what rele the CIA 1s playing inthe plot to overthrow our democratic

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/LA/CAM, .

1. In a meeting with Assistant Secretary Rogers today,
he told me that he had learned from Foreign Minister Facio
that Bosch, at the time of his arrest in San Jose during the
Kissinger visit, had two recently issued passports from the...

- current Chilean government. Facio also said that 10-to 12, AQ
persons also had come into Costa Rica with Bogch but the aot
- Costa Ricans do not know who they are nor have they been ~ ms i
able to locate them. I mentioned to Rogers that a U.S. a0
_ Secret Service agent had interviewed Bosch. : oe

[.. @. In view of State's interest.in this ease, I suggest
you send a cable to San Jose and try to find out the number
‘ef these Chilean passports and to whom they were. issued.
‘Also it might be worthwhile to have a summary of what Bosch
and the U.S. Secret Service agent talked about.
