be conducted in an SR safe house in New York. The SR revresen-
tative will probably request a safe house in Baltimore for the
final assessment and processing of those REDSKIN Agents that

are cleared in the initial screening by either BRADI” or{iekEE} 06
It should be noted at this point that SR Division plans to
process thirty or thirty-five REDSKIN Agents this year. Time
is, of course, of the essence, in view of the fact that these
people will have t- be assessed, security-cleared, briefed,

and trained, and arrangements for grants made before the sumer
season. :
