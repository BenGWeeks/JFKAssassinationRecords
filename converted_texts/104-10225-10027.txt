El Mercurio newspaper chain and key’ opposition radios, The long-.

- Fange goal is to create conditions that will insure Government

control over the media so that an emasculated opposition will operate
intuitively and through self-censorship within an approved framework:

The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal

include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of

essential Government advertiging revenue, ternporary closures,
and Govérnment-fomented etrikes, :
Chile's national television -- the only country-wide channel «- has
become an important Propaganda instrument for the Governrnent,

’ But it is being Challenged. by a Catholic University channel which is

attempting to expand its service beyond the Santiago area. . .

A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,
lasting more than a. year, hae taken place at the Papelera, Chile's’
only important private newsprint producer, with the company

Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the Opposition media

have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political —
situation currently Prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly
effective in exploiting the Government's #conomic failures and the
growing dissension within the ruling Marxist coalition,

Nevertheless, the opposition’s economic base that sustains its media ~
is being slowly undermined as the CGoverninent expands its control
over the Chilean economy, Many opposition media ore reportedly

CUP's-have been most active at'the union level: : demandi 2 exorbitant
wage increases, insisting that UP employees Le given the right to
express their opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union
meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company data to
the leftist press and to the Government, :

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding frecdom of
the press was most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing
committee for a conference of leftist journalists which was held in
Santiago in April 1971, The committee issued the following statement
prior to the conference: : :

...we believe that we must fight for true freedom of
the preas, which will only be possible when there is

_ true economic independence. We maintain that Chile
will have true freedom of the presa only when the means

_ of mags commmmnication are part of the area of social

The press, radio, television, and the theater must be
tools at the service of liberation and culture ‘of our
people and not a private business, an ideological
battering ram of the national and forcign minority
(the capitalists) as is presently the case, 7 (anders

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support and
defend the People’s Government (the UP) together with ali the workers,"
The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen for
“Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism,"

and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its “objective”
reporting of the Chilean phenomenon, Allende himself lent legitimacy

to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conference

when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "vanguard!
of the revolution by “elevating the political level of the peaple. "
Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende
asserted that his Government would respect freedom of information
while at the same time he lamented his Government's “excessive
tolerance" for the opposition media.

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest
with "bourgeois" radio owners, Long before Allende became president
the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio Stations
made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they believed
that leftists were superior professionals agd helped to increase
listenership, When the UP came to power it tapped an existing source

of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations
to gain its ends, Radio concessions are granted by a Government
entity (Servicios Electricos) attached to the Interior Nijnistry. The
same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions, Regulations
promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal
disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the
rules, control, and censorehip that the Government may adopt,"
Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were

committees to formulate exagyerated wape demauia, to foment”

The principal Government weapon, however, is ite control
over public service advertising, which traditionally has provided —
the bulk of revenues for Chilean radio stations, The Government
hae dangled the prospect of advertisernents in return for favorable

‘news treatment, but the bait has not been picked up by the major
opposition radios which recognize that their independence is at
stake. The economic squeeze makes the future cf Chilean
independent radios appear bleak.

C. Television

Since its inception in Chile in 1962, television has race great
aridm, but the medium etill lags behind radio, especially. in the
provinces where technical conditions for viewing are poor, Accord-
ing to the best cotimates 2vailablé, there are 350, 000 sete in
Santiago and a total of 500, 000 sets in the country, Chile is served
by the following television channels: 1) A national network with
some 21 o.tlets throughout the country; 2) the Catholic, University ~
channel in Santiago; 3) a separate Catholic University channel in
Valparafeo; and 4) the University of Chilg channel in Santiago,

The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as
a propaganda vehicle, and under the direction of an Allende :
confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected’
member of the ultra-lefe MIR -- Movement of the Revolutionary
Left), it has transformed Chile's only nationwide television channel
into an outright political instrument of the Government coatition,
Slanted commentaries favoring UP policies, character assassinations
intended to smear political and class opponents, and a steady drum |
fire of Socialist propaganda in news and cultural programming

private producers went out of business, squeezed by rising production
coete and discriminatory tax. and exchange rate treatment that denied
“them needed equipment and spare parts from advroad, Chile Films
signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 197! with the Cuban
Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Section V. C. Exchange of

. Persons, Visitors, and Exchanee Agreements).

Chile Films also initiated agreements with the experimental film
institute (leftist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the
Communist-dominated State Technical University (UTE), the Govern-
ment information office, the film department of the Communist«
dominated CUT (Central Unica de Trajabadores -- the major labor

organization), the national television networs, and the University of

Chile television station. The. stated purpose of the accords was to
“develop the new Chilean film industry."

Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants,
and studente in the march to Chilean-style Socialism, romanticize the
proletarian role of the Chilean Communist and Socialist Parties, and
attack the "bourgeoisie" acd their “imperialist” allies. Despite an
intense publicity buildup, hawever, few films actually appeared in
the 1970-72 period. Most.of the films that were produced appeared to
be pieced together from newsreel film taken during the Allende .

‘people have oll power and in accord with the consti-

émajority of the nation behind them."

Yet it was precisely the.question cf majority sup:
port that was Aliende’s centryl problem in his de-
sign to carry out a peaceful transition to “socialism
with democracy, pluralism and liberty.” The parties -
In his coalition -were in a distinct minority in the
Congress, and although there was no doubt about the
Jegitimacy of his élection by that body, his victory
had only been possible because of the conditional
-| Support of the Christian Democrats. The PDC, it
should be noted, included both Radomiro Toric,
the party's:.1970 presidential candidate, who had
gone to Allende’s. house to: conpratulate him the
day ‘after the popular election, clearly inferring his
futirre support, and conservatives like Senator Juan
“de. Dios Carmona, who had fought within the party
to prevent It from voting for Allende’ in the run-off.
In the Immediate aftermath of the election the POC”
was controlled by the Tomic forces, who claimed
to be In-favor of “communitarian” socialism, nation-
alization. of copper, acceieration of agrarian reform,
and reduction of Chile’s dependencia on the United
States, One way, then, for Allende to achieve his |
acknowledged goal of majority support for the’
transition to socialism would have been to try to
arrive at an understanding with the Christian Ocmo-
crats on the points in his program with which ‘they
were In agreement. This might have provoked the.
secession of some of the rightist members of the
POC, but If an accord had been reached with the
party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende
a majority in the Congress for at least part of his
program.

Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to
terms with the party which he had termed “the new
face of reaction” during the campaign, Allende chose
an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec-
tions were not. scheduled to take place until March
1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in
| the event of a conflict. with the Congress over the
text of a constitutional amendment, the President.
could call a national plebiscite. The strategic course.
adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu-
lar support for his coalition and then propose a
constitutional amendment which, in accordance with
the Popular Unity electoral program, would replace
the existing bicameral legislature with a unicameral

house, to-be elected immediately following the ap-
proval of the amendment. The Congress would be
certain to reject the amendment, but if Allende
had the support of a majority In the country, he
could win the plebiscite and secure control of the

lished. = *

‘the preceding year's inflation (35 percent in 1970)
in favor of the low-income sector of the population

crease). The utilization of unused industrial ca-
pacity, combined with strict enforcement of price
controls, more stringent collection of taxes, and re-
fusal to devalue the Chilean escudo ‘in relation to
the dollar, were expected to contain possible infla-
tionary pressures which might result. (The Allende
government also had a cushion of nearly’ $400

government as a result of high international prices
for copper, Chile's principal export.)

forces controfied the executive and pursued an in-

Congress. This legislative act, zeferred to as an

amendment on the “Three“Areas of Property,” be- |

came the focus of a continuing deadlock between
the President and Congress that’ lasted - until
Allende’s overthrow in September 1973. ,
Altende's refusal to accept the amendment or to
call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the
Congress appeared to the congressional opposition
to be a decisive indication of his determination to
bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular
Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of

the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats:

began to cooperate with the rightist parties in- op-
posing the executive. One method was to impeach
ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce-
ment of the taw. The first of many such impeach-
ments took place in January 1972. Another method
was to present a united electoral front against the
government. Informal cooperation between the
rightist parties and the Christian Democrats led to
striking victories in two by-elections in January 1972,

a letter asking for his resignation. W/nen the cemon-
stfifion was broken up by police tear gas, it pro-
voked such dissension in the armed ‘forces that ‘on
the following day General Prats decided to resign
both as Defense Minister and Army Commander. He
was joined by two other generals who, with Prats,
had led the mititary forces that had queticd the
tank-regiment revolt in June. .

On August 9 Allende swore In what. he called a
“national security cabinet,” with General Prats as
Defense Minister, Air Force Commander César Ruiz
as Minister of Transport (the ministry which would
deal with the striking truckers), and the heads of
the Navy and of the National Police in other cabinet
posts.

Almost colncident with the entrance. of the mil-
itary into the cabinet, the naval establishment be-
came involved in a serious conflict with the left wing
of the Allende coalition. On August 7, the navat
Intelligence arm announced the discovery of a plot
to carry out an enfisted men’s revolt on August 11 in
Valparaiso and Concepcién. The announcement
accused PS Secretary General Carlos Altamirano,
MAPU leader Oscar Garreton, and Miguel Enriques,
head of the MIR, of being the “intellectual authors”
of the revolt and demanded the lifting of the con-
gressional immunity of the first two, who sat respec-
tively In the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
Two days before the September coup, Altamirano
admitted that he had encouraged navymen to resist
their coup-minded (goipista) officers."

This attempt to subvert the hierarchy of a service
command from below was combined with maneuvers

coincided with the adoption on the same day of 2
“sense of the house” (acuerdo) resolution by the
Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and
the military ministers, drawing their attention to
“the serious breakdown of the constitutional and
lepal orcer.” * The resolution criticized the Allende
fovernment for repeatedly bypassing the legislature
through the use of iegal loopholes and for refusing
10 promulgate the constitutional reforms vo'ed by
the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial
orders, encouraging iticgal seizure of property, perse-
cuting opposition labor groups, and supporting
illegal paramilitary organizations. In conclusion, it
stated that the listed actions constituted a “serious

broadcast a communiqué to the nation. While ad-
mitting that the Allende government had initially
come to power by legal means, they announced that
it had “falten into flagrant illegitimacy” by violsting
fundamental rights, by “artificially fomenting the

-class struggle," by refusing to implement the de

cisions of the Congress, the judiciary and the
Controller-General, by causing a critical decline in
agricultural, commercial and ‘industrial. activity In
the country, and by bringing about a state of in-
flation and anarchy which “threaten the internal and

concluded: : .

Allende in’ Retrospect

Ce

Snecite aspects of the Chilean system also made
tha Allende experiment a particularly difficult one.
He was able to come to power in the first place
because of Chile's deeply-rooted commitment to the
democratic. system and because the Marxist parties
were able to mobilize'a part of the proletariat and
the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many
instruments tor state control of the economy which
had been developed by previous administrations
since the -1930's. However, he was required to
operate within an institutional system which included
frequent ‘and: staggered elections, proportional rep:
resentation, and a multiparty system which made
Majority rule very difficult-and often gave veto pow:
ers. to the-extremes of Ripht.and Left. The economy
had been characterized for nearly a century by 3
chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern-
ments had consistently ignored agriculture in the
Interest of securing urban electoral support. The

most important systemic constraint of alt, of course,

was the existence of a professionalized and insti-
tutionally-loyal military which was unresponsive to
the Ideological blandishments of the Lelt.”*

- The immediate causes of the military intervention
are apparent from the preceding account. In the last
part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean

politics by both sides and became as polarized as:

the rest of Chilean society—with the overwhelming,
majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-
flict. over education in March-April 1973 heignht-
ened that polarization Just at the time the military
were‘atiempting to extricate themselves from politi-
cal Involvement. Then’ the expansion of arms
searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which
Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge

7 of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing

military hierarchy by 2 combination of teftist activ-
ity among enlisted men and presidential. maneuver-
ing with promotions and retirements provided the
classis scenario for a coup d'état:

: 20 RCEREUSTE TC
One can also relate Allenae’s duttculties to the
inherent contradictions in the Maraist theory to which
2 appeated.. At the same time that he proclaimed
lig faith in a democratic, pluratist. and libertarian
transition to socialism, many ot his Marxist.sup-
porters spoke and acted.on the basis of a belief In
he inevitability of armed confrontation, With his
knewledge, they armed themselves and—-what was
worse—talked incessantly about revolution, The re-
peated Statements ct Régis Debray and others that
the observance of the rules of “bourgeois” legality
was only a tactic until the balance of forces had
improved was hardly likely to persuade doubters of
the sincerity of Allende’s commitment to democracy. |
When the importation and distribution of arms was
combined with efforts to reorganize education along
ideological lines, to sUbvert military discipline, and
to rearrange the hierarchy of command, It Is not
altogether surprising that the military finally took
action. .

A positive-evaluation of the. Alleride years would
certainly credit him with a sincere effort to ralse
tog living standards ot low-income groups and to
involve them actively In the determination of thelr
own future. It would likewise stress the continucd
existence of freedom of expressicn for all points of
view in Chile right up to the coup, A more negative
assessment would ask whether the low-income
groups in Chile genuinely benefited from an eco-
nomic policy. which after the first halt of 1972 pro-
duced hyperinflation, a continuous drop in agrl-
éultural and industrial production, and a reduction
in the real value of wages and salaries. Even more

ENCOUNTER, Londoa oo. ,

January 197h

, Stl so keenly reenembered and the generals who
, Made it are ming unplcusuntly high, the fact
remains that Sclvador Allende died a lucky
‘man In Ife he wes a failure. Both his policies
: aod bis country were shattercd long before the
ead. But in death he achieved success beyond his
dreams. InstanUy canonised as the Western
world’s “newest left-wing martyr, he became
: overvight the most potent political cult-figuro
" since Lis old fricad, Che Guevara.
To some extent, of courte, the congregation
had alresdy. been prepared fot
elevation. In the three years of All

stration the ~Chilean’ experiment’ and the -

“Chilean road to socialisin had become fave
ourite topics of discussion among Iefi-wing
groups in Europe, where Chile's supposed
resemUiane to Italy or France bad encouraged

the belief that Burope might, for once, foliow in”

Latin America’s footsteps instead of the: ‘other
way about. Many espiring revolutionaries from
Europe and the Uniied States had actually

democrats, For them, 6s much as for the self-

Cuccholovakia that ended Alexander Dubock’s
régime in 1963 (The Observer, 16/9/7}), ”

Within 24 hours of the first, bare news of the
coup the General-Secretary of the British Labour

* pany, Mr Ron Hayward, was writing offically

to one of Allende’s former colleagues to say that
it was dificult to express the sense of horror and
anget felt by the British Labour movement “as

the aspirations of the working people of Chile— *

shared by so many others around the world—
ere destroyed at the hands of a few arrogant and
ignorant officers acting at the behest of those

who believe their right to rule is Unchallengeable”-

(The Times, 13/9{73). Me Lea Murray, Generale
Sccretury of the Trades Union Council, expressed
his shock and abhorrence with equal speed and
vigour, Aod Mrs Judith Hart, speaking as a

Member of the Labour Party's National Execue
tive, unleashed 3 torrent of assertions so passionate

as to suggest that her mind had come close to

- being overthrown with Allende’s government,
“They ranged from the declaration that “the

demacratic will of the people of Chile” had been
defeated by capitalist “collusion” (The Guardian,
17/9;73) to “for Socialists of this generation
Chile is our Spain” and “This is the most vicious

Guardian, 19/9/73).

Hence the composite picture, now accepted

fascist conspiracy on behalf of a minority “ruling
class” aided and abcited by the Unit States
of Americe.

IN RetROserCT, I am inclined to’ think this was
always tho truth of the matter: with Allende,

* Basically, he was a political romantic, dealing ia *
sensations mither than sense. He enjoyed his hour .
“upon the stage but-he never properly sensed .

w the forces he was dealing with, either for or :
against him. He raised expectations on his owa

- side without commanding the means to satisfy
them, and he encouraged opposiioa on the
otber side by his use‘of a revolutionary rhetoric

‘whose threats ho also could noc ful. ,

: At best he was muddle-headed; and time may
show that he was deliberately deceitful. Certainly |
he managed to deceive a lot of people, including .
himself. But in the end reality taught its own, hard *
lessons. That you can’t bea dgnocrat and a
Tevolutionasy—at Jeast, not in a socic.y that is
already admittedly democratic. That you can’t
be anti-American and expect the Americans to
help you. That you can't pose ns the people's

_ leader end kick most people in the tecch. That
you can’t conscript soldicrs into potitics and
expect them to remain apolitical. That you can’t
have inflation roaring out of sight end maiatain a
base for social welfare. That, in shozt, the real |
world is not Cloud-cuckoo-land, Down bere,
you just can’t have your cake aneat it

It is sad that such elementary lessons should
have to be taught yet again at such tragic cost in

* Chile. But it is alarzring that s9 many peoplo
elsewhere should evidently fail to grasp that they
are the lesson, { .

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Editorial by N. van Be gyenhuysens Reformatorisch Dagblad,

Dutch, 19 April 1974, p

.The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be
having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms:
seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
their Marxist president. is definitely over and that their
country is now being ruled by a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, repression, and torture. Such problems will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

what is the situation? Most of the approximately
259 refugees with a high school or university education do
not.work. About half of them have been housed at the “Huis
ter Schie” in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. Board and
lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than’
many. old people in the Netherlands? You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.

Considering that this small proup.of pampered exiles
is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach,
it may be. useful to point out a few facts. These are facts
which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague: but for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts
The great majority of the refugees are not even cele

Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and .

Uruguay. They came to Chile as a regult of illeral and

revolutionary. activities in which they had been involved in

these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate

consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His first action as
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnesty for all those who “were members of terrorist
underground organizations," those who during the last months
of. his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and | attempted

murder. :
The fact that some of those revolutionaries received

Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries,

' These refugees with a high school or higher level education

seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the
government.

‘The fugitives didn't ‘suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Varxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutionaries,
from all points of the compass, were at ‘their disposal.

Definition a

In the Berner Tageblatt, a Swiss newspaper which
is known for not exsuneraticgs Dr. Mario Puelma, from the
University of Freiburg, wrote the following: "The concept
of political refugee . is only of limited value when applied.

to Chile. Whatever ona’s attitude toward the military junta


--- Page 108 ---
14-0000

may be, one thing is certains the Chilean refugees were not

pursued only because of thelr ideology, thoir status, or . i
their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini- - 1
tion for a refupee. For the most part they are people who, :

‘in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes

which are punishable under any judicial system.

These refugees carried out activities in Chile which i
were against the constitution. As a matter of fact, they are
specialists in violence. Thig is why they sought asylum in :
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are 30 many

foreigners among them."

MARKETS IW “COMMODITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE. WHILE EXCHANGE RATES

CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE. THE GROUTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS BEEN
SHARPLY CURTAILED» CAUSING A RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY AND
A LIQUIDITY CRUNCH FOR BUSINESSREN.

“v0 De “THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY. DESPITE A
HEALTHY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM UAGE, WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS ARE

FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT T) AFFORD THE GAREST NECESSITIES.

AUSTERITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES BY DISMISSALS OF

RELATIVELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND POLITICALLY SUSPECT EMPLOYEES HIRED

UNDER THE ALLENDE REGIME. AN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM HAS

BEEN ANNOUNCED AND AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS UNDER CON-
SIDERATION«

E. THE JUNTA IS ATTEMPTING TO ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR
THE AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND BUSINESS TS SHOWING RENEWED CONFIDENCE.
CONSUMERS AND LABORS HOUEVER, ARE TAKING A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE. NO

F. CHILE STILL FACES LARGE BALANCE-oF- PAYMENTS DEFICITS
IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974.EVEN IF DEDT-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH
YEARS. UITH A MASSIVE 64 BILLION FOREIGN DEOT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S
HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-oF=
PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY.”

G- HOUEVERs COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED HORE
“THAN 50% ABOVE LAST YEAR'S LeveL AS A RESULT OF A 9% LENGTHENING OF

THE WORK WEEK AND IMPROVED MINE MANAGEMENT. PRODUCTION WILL PROBABLY

REACH A RECORD 750,000 TONS NEXT: YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES OF
, SPARE PARTS AND SERVICEABLE VEHICLES. .
H. AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO GE THE LARGEST DRAIN
ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE RECOVERY OF. DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS A
PRIORITY OBJECTIVE OF THE JUNTA. FARM OUTPUT, HOWEVER, IS NOT Ex-
PECTED TO FULLY RECOVER. UNTIL THE 1924/75 HARVEST SINCE HOST CROPS
ALREADY ARE PLANTED AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR GROWING SEASONS. THUS,
CHILE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT GRAIN IN LARGE QUANTITIES DURING 1574.
