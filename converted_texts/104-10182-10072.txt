: Mitchell Livingston Werbell, Il

. : re Co As-you are-aware, on the instruction of United States

ae - District Judge Peter Fay (Miami,. Florida Division), incident to

rr: -* ‘the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject

mo . |. for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of

marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of. the files

of this Agency concerning Subject.in August 1976. This exami-

. nation’ was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guiltor — |
|
i
{

innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the
_ _ nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government. -
we , This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's view that
Werbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
condonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the

jury.

2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agency
‘contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: one regarding
non-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice and the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies
are attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to
_counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which . . we
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never a

x formal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency- Sheres
subsequently returned the affidavits ‘to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.

3, Regarding the relationship of Werbell to the Agency, as’
. approved by the Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before
- Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered
- : questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of thé transcript
'», of that_proceeding is attached. You will note that Judge Fay requested
.. that all pertinent government records be made available to the Court
‘for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced,
te so oo culled for "Brady-type" ddcuments, excised to protect sources and
: , methods under the "SWP case criteria" and. reviewed and approved by.
Assistant DD/O-on the evening of 1 September. These processed
documents Were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on
2 September.

. 4. The undersigned advised Judge Fay at 0330 hours on
‘September that‘: had'in my possession copies of all of the ‘Agency
‘files of Werbel!,had- culled them as to possible-"Brady" documents
and was.prepared to review them with the Judge at his convenience.
e was on the bench with a tight schedule and 2sked that the possible
“Brady documents. first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance - ;
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy :
we) 6=ACt request. (Tabs A-and B of OS response) » consisting of media : fi

publications and security investigative data, were also provided

_Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's

“use of a’ boat named "Venus" belonging to CIA, a declassified copy i
Be, of the OS short investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's | i

use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The :

related OS Headquarters assignment document was rot provided.

Related DDO documents on the ownership-of Venus by the "JURE"

Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but rot made available.

5. While the above dcecuments were provided the. Department of ©
. 7 Justice with the undérstanding they could be passed to Counsel for
. Werbell due to subsequent évents noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady" documents without consultation and instructions

:
i
:



--- Page 9 ---
_from the Court. The requested meeting was put off by Judge Fay ane
defendante subsequently rested their case. The DOJ had little else
to add and the case went to the jury about noon on 3 Sept. mber. All
the remaining copies of Agency ducuments were returned to Headquarters
- by the undersigned the'evening of 3 September. On4 Sc ptember the
jury. returned,a verdict of “not guilty." As a result, the bulk of
"Brady-type" Agency documents o> Werbell was not provided to
counsel for:Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.
It should be noted all-copies of documents taken to Miami were excised
in-accord with the "SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters, -
these were destroyed by the undersigned. :

6. ‘As a ‘related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert
of the Interna! Security Division of the DEA contacted the undersigned
background information on Werbell. Tre undersigned suggested.
first. review the files of the FBI on Werbell as’most of the data
ntainéd in FBI reports. Should FBI data be insufficient .
for his neéds 1- -siiggested | he seek access ta our files in DLO and Office
of Security via the normal DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOG

Chief, DCD 2 .
\ Chief, LA Division, (WHAOCOZ
SUBJECT :' Mitchell Livingston Werbel TI

’

‘ a. t was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
_ Werbel has beeri indictéd and the trial is scheduled to begin on. 29 March
. in Miami, Florida’ “The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past :
" .. affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial. .
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
. i. Marger who was thi ense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
‘Buffalo, New Yerk in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA .
_ General Counsel as a*defense witness, : ~

i ve se :
i 2. The Justice Department has.received information that a person

either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating’
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all

. addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there

j is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
‘tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place.
between now and the beginning of the trial. * :

3. It would be helpful if each addressee could’prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was ki'led in

' Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975, Bayard, reportedly an
” associate of Werbel's, had Previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business

MERQRANOUM FOR, THE RECORD.-

SUBJECT: Alleged Activities of. Watter Macken.
Do ee i ‘During-the week: of March 9, I lunched with Mr. Wesley
yt Dyckman, - Oyckman is-a former ‘Agency staffer currently employed .
‘by -the.Drug Enforcement Agency. During the-course of our lunch-
eon’ conversati he .name:of Walter Mackem came up.- Dyckman
told’.me that Mackem,. a JOT@ classmate of ours, had been fired. by
: -the Agency.-« According to“Dyckman, Mackem is how employed tn the
' Washington area as a private investigator, In addition, accord-
+! ing to Dyckman, Macken is involved with a paramilitary activity

\ funded by some unnamed British source. The activity, which
Dyckman-referred to'as “the new land project” seeks to establish
a tax shelter on one of the out-islands of the Caribbean by : .
| forcefully taking over the island and establishing a government — :

there. Mackem is supposedly involved in paramilitary training
of forces who would participate in this paramilitary adventure . . fe
again. According to Dyckman, the parazilitary training sunposedly Ses

‘takes place in Georgia not far from Atlanta. : . ,

2. This is the extent of my conversation with Dyckman-on-tie~

the reriral—of the classic free-

Long before the Dow hit the. five

fifty cents a cup, long before old

farmers ‘dumping their calves into

had made his first million by thirty’
(real-estate development, construc-

fifty, Oliver was the president of

Miss Nevada in 1970. Yet for
most ten years, where other bu:

vined a long-range trend toward de- .

pression and disaster.

Worldwide travel and an intense
reading of economics helped con-
vince him by 1965 that, as he told
a visitor years later, “They're go- -
ing to screw up the money.” He
felt certain that debauchery of the
dollar would lead to political crisis,
intlation, and ultimately to sume
sort of dictatorship.

Persons under Congressional Investigation fos -

‘de Press reports of Sentator ‘Lowell P, Weicker! s investigation of
CIA's involvement with other government agencies surfaced the contact
of Lucien Conein-of ‘DEA, a former employce, with an electronic manu-
facturer named Michael Morriséy.: The same reports have alsotied | _ -
Morrisey with a Mr. Mitchell L, WerBell, Ill, who, according’ ‘to our. 7 . .
files, has claimed United States Government and CIA connections in
an the past. According to DEA, WerBell recently invoked
~ ment when apsearing before Senator Jackson's Suscommi:
DEA on whether or not he supplied arms to Robert Vesco. “Also,
‘ not mentioned in the press, at least-one retired CLA staffer and possibly -
two others may have been involved with Conein and Morrisey. The ex-
staffer is John P. Muldoon, a friend of Conein's, who currently is a
private’ security specialist who has dealt with Morrisey in the purchase
of audio Sweeping devices for his business. Muldoon was retained t by ~ ,
WerBell curing first half of 1974. The other two, W lter J, Mackem,,
an: acquaintance of Conein's,, anda Theodore J, Rous: os, ‘bath of whom
‘were in contact. with WerBell for possible employment in a scheme to
_-pramate- the-secession’of the Bahamian Island of Abaco, an enter prise
“publicized in February 1975 issue of Esquire by Andrew St. George.

~ 2. We have no information in our files on the B, R. Fox Coimpany
or:the Fox Con pany principals mentioned in the press acem
however, told by DEA that Mr. San dy Smith, Time maja
was working on a story to the effect that the late Bernard S;
“owner of the Fox Company, was previously involved in “wire t
the Teamsters Union and providing explosive devices for organized crime."
Although Mr. Smith did not allege that either CIA or DEA were associated °
with the Fox Company or Spindel, had
no intention of dropping the story and we can expect farther | press coverage.

3. In conclusion, there has Leen no CLA involy ement with the
B. R. Fox Company or with Michael Morrisey. “Morcover, Mr. WerBell's
clairns of CIA affiliation or support over the years are simply not true.

"7 July 1959 for-this purpose. By October. 1959 it was apparent that he

in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had CIA connections

queried the Agency re Mr. WerBell, asking if WerBell ha¢ a contractual’

the aboritve Haiti invasion. . The Office of the General Counsel placed the
matter in perspective. Subsequently, he contacted the Agency to request

All three inviduals reported their involvement with the WerBell group
and had sought guidance from the Agency. In May and June they were
advised to break all ties with WerBell. “On 27.June 1974 the FBI was
formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in

‘the effort'to bring: Abaco's secession. In September 1974 WerBell

MEMORANDUM FOR. THE RECORD
‘SUBJECT: Meeting with Theodore Roussos on 31, August 1974 —

4, During subject meeting Mr. Roussos told me that
Mr. Mitchell Livingston WERBELL IlI-called him from Atlanta
n 29 August and. again. on 30° August. Werbell told Roussos

“twat he-wasleaving. for Athens on Saturday, 31 August in-

order to try to sell arms to the Greek government. Werbell.

“wanted. Roussos. tobe his advisor in this venture.and to
,go to Athens: Werbell indicated -that ‘the total-deal -could

‘reach $5,000,000, Roussos told Werbell that he would
check with -his “friends” (the Agency) before giving

Werbell an answer. derbell asked Roussos to see if his
“friends” were in favor of such arms deals or. not. Roussos

had generally explained this call to me on the telephone

" ‘on 29 August. My reaction on the telephone was negative
.~to Roussos’ participation in such a deal, and he had

conveyed this: negative reply to Werbell by telephone

. before: Roussos and I met personally on 31 August.

2. During our ‘personal meeting, Roussos explained
that Werbell intended to pursue arms sales legally and
via the required U.S. Government channels. He said that
Werbell does have the capabilities to design and produce
weapons because of his access to arms factories, I told
Roussos that Werbell's businesssactivities were his own
concern. i strongly advised against his getting involved
in this deal. I explained to him the problems which the
U.S. Government was having in Greece and the current wave

: of anti-Americanism and press attacks against the CIA.
If Roussos.as a former CIA offtcer well known in Greece

became involved in sucn a venture, a flap of substantial
proportions was likely complete with widespread press
play. Roussos understood and agreed not to get involved. —

MEMORANOUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA: _. Deputy Director for Operations —
SUBJECT: ; Mitchell Livingston Werbell IIT

1. Mitchel? Livingston Werbel? III, who served briefly

with the OSS in WWII, has been engaged for the past several
“years. in arms: dealings and swash-buckling promutional
Lactivities which have brought him tothe attention of various

gov: ment agencies... He has always: remained within the

law fineedge: His latest scheme involves a. Movement
for. the Independence of Abaco, an island to the East of the
Bahamas. For. this -he has: obtained apparently substantial
financial support from wealthy Americans and from a British

- Lord. oo

2. Werbell operates through a number of front businesses
in. Washington,.0.C. and fn Marietta, Georgia, where he owns
‘one outfit named Central Information Agency (CIA). In all
his dealings, Werbell broadly hints that he has current

.-connections with the Agency. We have just learned that

Werbell may be in possession of a one-line note from you,

“stemming from a chance meeting with you at an OSS alumni

dinner, reading something like "gocd to see you again.”

3. Three retired Agency employees are currently employed

by Werbell in various capacities. This past spring these

employees sought contact with tne Agency basically to report
their concern over the legality of werbell's activities. We

‘quickly established that the matter was outside our charter

and asked these retirees to report directly to the Federal |

’ Bureau of Investigation.. We also furnished the Bureau with

all the pertinent.information in ou: files. It is to be
noted that somewhere in Werbell's scheme of things there
appears the ubiquitous Andrew St. George, who plans to write
a story on Abaco for True magazine. .

14 August 1974”:

MEMORANOUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Call from John MULDOON

: 1. Approximately 1655 hours, 13 August 1974, a call
was received on C/kH/7's extension, 351-4221 by the Secre-
tary, Miss Annamarie Ruppert. She answered the extension
by number and “the male voice asked to speak to Mr. McTighe.
The secretary. asked who was calling and the caller replied
: John - ‘MULDOON, me The secretary then replied that she was
ry “but. Mr. MéTighe couldn't.be reached. In response to
‘MULDOON's..query, "Why' not?" and before the. secretary could

. toe reply, MULDOON became. obstinate and asked who he was speak-
Lose . "dng to. - Miss -Ruppert replied "his secretary" and then

’ added that Mr. McTighe was away. ‘When MULDOON asked. where
he was, the secretary replied that she was not at liberty
to discuss that. ‘Then MULDOON asked to speak’ to McTighe's
_ deputy and was told that there was no one around whom
--+, . ° MULDOON could speak to. (C/WH/7 was on leave and AC/WH/7
wecteoee’ was dn the PMC meeting.) MULDOON apparently didn't believe
- this reply but then asked when McTighe was expected to '
: : return. The secretary replied "within a few weeks"
eo. : ° = "(McTighe is on TDY) and then asked if she could take a
“ : _ message to give to McTighe upon his return. MULDOON ‘
became belligerent at this point, apparently thinking he-
was getting the ‘run around’ and replied, "just tell him
to talk to Jack Anderson" and hung up.

2. “AC/WHD was briefed on the above telephone call at
1740 hours, 13 August. He decided no action should be taken
’ on 13. August, but would like to meet with C/WH/7, Al Spera,
on 14 August.

3. At 0950 hours, the » following met with AC/WHD:
Mr. Natzke, Mr. “Wedemeyer, Mr. Spera and Miss Lehman. In
view of C/WHD's previous decision that no further Agency
contact should be made With MULDOON, RUSSOS, or ACKEM it
‘was decided that no one would return MULDOON's call. How- .
ever, AC/WHD would brief ADDO, Mr. Blee, on the above threat, : :
- and WH/7 would ask OPS/LIAISON to telephonically pass to the :
FBI the fact that MULOOON again. contacted the Agency and
“. threatened to’ go: to “Jack Anderson. A copy of this memoran-
dum is being sent to OPS/LIAISON for this ‘purpose.

at an OSS alumni dinner, reading something like "Good to see

suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-

mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974.

: 10. According to reporting from several Station’, WER BELL:
and Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in several
Central American countries during August and early. September... -- 5 eo
1962. Their principal activity appeared to be contact ing
an
El Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recognition of a
de facto Cuban Government in exile called the "United .
Organization . for the Liberation of Cuba." In discussions with
Nicaraguan Government representatives, WER BELL ‘claimed the

proposed Cuban Government in exile had the support of 90

separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles.-
WER BELL offered a.representative of the Nicaraguan Government
$100,000 to obtain that governnent ''s recognition of the Cuban
Government in exile. The sroup claimed to have its headquarters
at 1025. Connecticut Avenuc, Nw, in yvashington,, D.C. While in
Guatemala, Smith claimed that the group had a man in the

Mr.. Baker said that he understood that WER BELL does this for

Baker said that che was afraid that his past smuggling record —

might, keep him from getting a CIA clearance.

14, WER BELL came to the attention of the Bangkok Station
in early 1969 when he went to Thailand represent ing himself

as Vice President of Sionics, Atianta, Georgia. He described
himself as a counterinsurgency expert, had a variety of weapons
to: display, claimed to be a retired colonel, and introduced
himself at a local nightclub as Chief of CIA in.Thailand.
WER BELL -attenpted to sell arms to the Thais and also, to a
variety of J. S. military etenrats. Station Bangkok passed
the gist of his reputation to y personalities in the U..S.

-6. Most recently, WERB ELL has proposed to both
retired officers in separate -conversations, that they |
conduct.a study, involving a visit to Abaco, to deternine
the feasibility of “Abaco's independence in political and
econozic terms. The study would include interviews with
‘citizens on Abaco prior to an alleged “plebiscite” on
independence to take place in Abaco on 38 June 1974,

To be included in the investigation is research on the
probable reaction in the United Nations Organization to
a petition from political groups in Abace for support on
independence, notably any parallels to be found in
precedents such.as the Biafra secession fron Nigeria.

' Subject: Agency Retiree's Involvement. wit
_i.._.Abaco Independence Group =

: ‘1.. Through the intermediary of Robert Brown,. DC/EA,
“and retired :staffer Jack "Red" Stent, I was put in- touch
>On 22 ‘May with John MULDOON, another retired statfer
who is no inal vice-president of a Washington-based

ob: Brown and Red Stent whose’ counsel he-

h nvolvement with a group promoting...
ndepe te" of “the “Bahamian Commonwealth~island- of -- -
Abaco. We met’ at 1100 ‘hours at "Tony's" on:L street
‘and 18th N.W. "in. downtown Washington. Red ‘Stent-was-: ;
-there to introduce me to Muldooa but he did not participate

- in the discussion.

2. Muldoon presented me with a typewritten report
containing the essential data he possessed concerning
a_group of individuals with whom he had met on Friday, ~
17, May 1974 -in Washington. Attending the meeting with
Muldoon on that occasion were Mitchel! WERBELL III (aka
“Mitch Three"), Lord and -Lady BELLHAVEN (alleged British
peers), Mike OLIVER (a wealthy electronics tycoon of
European, ‘possibly, French, origin who currently resides
in Carson City, Nevada), Howard HANDELMAN (Washington
correspondent of "U.S. News’ and World Report"), Renee
(Inu) (the evening's object of Werbell's seemingly
voracious affections) and an emplove of the Library of
Congress whom-Muldoon chose not to identify to me. At
a subsequent meeting on Monday, 26° May 1974, Muldooa
had lunch with WERBELL and free lance writer Andrew St.
GEORGE who is also involved with WERBELL in the Abaco
independence enterprise. “The Werbell. group is known
as the "Friends of Abaco” (already documented as such
in our files). uo :

which poses as the metropolitan capital of Abaco; he
frequently visits Miami where he meets with Werbell.

b. “Mitchell WERBELL III - A Phidadelphian,

 WERBELL was a member of OSS in the Far East during World

War II where, according to. Muldoon, he came to know the
Director and Lou Conein. Werbell. currently a resident.
of Atlanta, now is president of: an international arms
peddling firm called Defense Syste International (DST).
In addition to industrial security systems, according to
MULDOON, DSI seils automatic weapons (including a minia-
ture machine pistol with a silencer) and bomb: booby- trapped" ~
items of various sorts (e.g., a tennis ball with a fuse.
which is automatically activated when you stop playing)
and other James Bondian accessories. Werbell hopés to
establish gaming casinos, hotels and other tourist
facilities in Abaco catering to the U.S. tourist crowd
available for easy ferrying from nearby Miami. As a
consequence of some run-in with Prime. Minister Michael
Pindling, ‘however, Werbell is apparently permanently .

persona non -xrata in the Bahamas; hence his ambitions

appear to be contingent on Abacan independence.

c. Mike OLIVER - The financial angel of the
“Friends of Abaco," Oliver's origins and auspices are
somewhat obscure to Muldoon. OLIVER claims to have spent

Muldoon and -I arrived to meet Stent we fouind him ensconced
at a-corner table with three other people. Red rushed

like Jerry Colonna, was intent on the task of seducing
Miss. BOTOND, who happened to be promoting a convention
forthe Atlantic Union organization, a political enterprise
which is an offshoot of the World Federalists Movement.
Miss BOTOND, as it turned out was reared in Shanvhai, China,
at thé same time as Stent. ‘Red had attended school with
cher brother. - the German Schoul in Shanghai. Miss BOTOND

“had been expelled from the. German school in the late 1930s

Brownlow had helped Red obtain. aerial photos of the.

‘RE: Current Bahamian Situation =

: The folowing peopte were contacted by ‘the writer:

day Matlin (Decenber. 3, 1973.) Mallin states that to the

best of his knowledge there are only two groups known to be active in the

-:"JAbaco-Mowenént=-the group that 'WerBel (Mitchel? Livingston WerBel III) fs

associate with and a group being headed up by a Bob Brown,

‘Brown is currently in Washington ana 4s about to return to his home

“which is in Boulder, Colorado. “Mallin Indicated that if anything were about
to occur Brown would certainly be fn the Miami area.

: ‘Brown {is a whi te American and an ex-Special Forces type. He has
formed, a group of. ex-Spectal ‘Forces Specialists that in Mallin’ s opinion
"could really raise Hell.* Brown, according to Mallin, has been working for

~ Chuck Hall. However, Hall is also aligned with Wergel,



--- Page 106 ---
Mallin states t *: al of the planning sessions ve Brown's group :
have been held in the tiving room of Pallin's Corat Gables home. °
. Brown's «group: 1s all white but he has been in contact with some or
. the local Blacks inAbaco. The Blacks have had no forinal training ‘nor do
. they possess the proper: weapons for any sizable operation. In order to |
\obtatn'weapons and training. the lacks have made friendly overtures to Srown's
‘group. - ;

Ballin stated that some of the local Blacks could | move on their Own

He. did not have any evidence to substantiate the

: Ina answer to asdirect. ‘question front “the wrt ter ‘Maltin furtner” commented ~
_ - : -that Paut ‘Bethat is totally. ‘out of ‘the: “Abaco situation. Bethal's only role, :
according to Mallin, was the one meeting he arranged for HerBel, Hall, a Michael
Lightbourne (Phonetic) and George, Wackenhut. Bethal, Mallin further stated, :
trys: to give people the impresston that he has very high ‘level connections
ine] uding members of the National “Security. Council. and..that .he prepares papers
-and other briefings for the Council. Matlin‘states that this is not true, that

-Bethal {n ‘fact has no such contacts,

Mallin- went on to say that WerBel would not get involved with anything
that would jeopardize his U.S, government contracts especially the sale of
hts silencer to the Amy, In addition, according to Mallin, WerBel 1s" Ja CIA

, informant and would advise the Agency of his activities. On Decenber 9, 1973,

Mallin § was vas recontacted by the writer, Chuck Hall travels to Miami a great
deal and contacts Mallin when he. does. Maltin said his last contact with Hall
was about two months ago. . Hall's supporters are mainly white although
