ce At the time of Subject's birth, Subject's father was
employed in the Brooklyn shipyards. However, he chenged jobs
frequently and was subsequently emplored on a farm near New
Brunswick, then in a shoe factory as a cutter, then as a butcher,
and finally became active in a Jewish cocperative organization.
As Subject's father became convinced that the future of the Jevs
vas in Russia under Soviet Commmism, in 1931 Subject's family
left the USA for the USSR for Birobidzhan where Subject's father
worked as en agronemist (be had sometime. prior thereto Eraduated
from the National Farm School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania).

in obtaining permission to return to the USA. Moreover, Subject's
father allegedly did not like life in the USSR; hovever, Sudject{s
mother and sister insisted that they return to the USSR after
only a brief stay in the USA. .

e. As a result, later in 1933 the entire AMON family once
again returned to the USSR. Again, Subjec. states that they bad no
probiems in obtaining autnorization from the Soviet governnent
for tais trip to the USSR. yon their xeturn to the USSR, they
estebdlished themselves in Moscow where one Noah LOMDGN, a friend
of the family and a construction engineer, took Subject's father
“into his employ". Subject's father worked in this capacity, in
the construction industry, from 1933 to 1936. Scuetine atter the
1936 purges bezgen, Subject's father worked for Komsazolsk, a Moscew
"panel board construction” outfit. In 1936 Subject's father also
worked for the Paris Commme as a shoeraker. Subject's mother

. Worked during this entire period as chief of a dining establisiment

in the school of foreign languages in Moscow. 0

f. Subject began his elementary education at the Dewitt Clisten
School in the USA where he studied until 1931; he then studied in
the Soviet secondary school in Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, util 1933.
In 1933 he again returmed for one semester to the Devitt Clinton
School. Later in 1933 and 1934 he attended the Anglo-American School
in Moscow where he completed his 8th grade of school. He then :
continued his stuiies from 1933 to 1936 in Public School £327 in the Qkth
Bauman Rayon. In 1936 he entered the Moscow Avtodorozhniy Institut

station of Janow.

ge In 1957 Subject's mother was dismissed froa her positioa
and both she en Subjec>'s fatzer begen to feel the pressure of the

purges. Subject's father, ailegedly by appealing to the then President

KALISIN, succeeced in again ecquiring exit visas for them to the
USS. Subject, woo admits that he had become a “good Commmist” ty
then had gotton “thoroughly steeped” in the Cazmmist philosophy,
elected to remain behind in the USSR. An important consideration,
he states, vas bis desire to complete his education which he vas
certain he would not be able to do in the USA for eccnomic reasons.

hh. According to Subject, his father never lost his American
citizenship. Susject's mother, hovever, in 1936 eppiied for aad
obtained Soviet citizensaipe necoruizg Wy Subgsst, ks setunlir
red Soviet citizenship “by default” although he never applied
his in person; he alleges that although he was 16 years of age

i. Subject remained in Moscow prices to World War . In April

1940 he married .

"“sorviet Proleteriat Rerirent”. A son was born to them in cune ifs.

Secause, as a mexber of the MiG, this was considered as equivalent

to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my’ query, Subject :
admitted that this vas umususl as his activities were .f a kind vhich
were performed by old woren particularly eince during this period,
from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soriet males
were drafted into the Soviet emmy. During this period Subject lived
in conparstive ease, being assigned to Suzdal and Klin, and other
towns, According to Subject, be wore an M.D wiform but vore no
insignia. He adnitted that “fevored treateent” was bestowed upon

him and his fenily when the MD assisted him in evacuating his first
wife and son from Moscow in Augist 1941 to beyond the Urals. (His
son by his first wite reportedly died on 11 Cctober 1943 of diabetes.)

ke In Septerber 1942, Subject received an appcintzent to the
Moscow and Militery Irfentry Icstitute from which he graduated in Jue
WOW? ont cen whitch be wer gives the greie of. Ge LS de che Sovies
Infentry. In response to ny cery, Subject again admitted that this
appointment was highly unusual as his background did not lend itsel?
to this, as appointrents were rade out of the various military
branches, and as this implied that, as a foreiger (American), he vas
fully end corpletel; trusted ty the Soviet punitive organs who had
cleared him both for this training and the institute end for promotion
to officer status in the Soviet Army. t

- 1, Initially he vas sent to Alatev on the Volga, then to Orel
where tx was assigned to the front lines in August 10:32. He was given a
Platoon of. infantry troops in the 415th Infantry Divisice of the
Sovzet Central Front. Sovever, in October 1943 he was wounded; he was

-bit in the left forehead by e German bullet. Fe was operated on in

a@ field hospital ana then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he
hed recovered sufficiently. He was reclassified after his recovery
and fond suitable to continue in military service wita the limitation
thet ke should not serve on the front lines (goden ytoroi stepent).

Bm. Because the wound fefled to heal completely (he bas a very
obvious scar, with approximately a 1" depression, on his forehead), -
he “asked” to be assigned to a warmer clirate. The Soviet authorities,
he states, cocplied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Thilisi
where he was placed in a speciai officer's camp; he wes hospitalized
again, bed osteomyelitis complications, and ultimately diecharged fron
the Soviet military forces. Eovever, Subject provided several
contradictory stories as to the date of discharge which at various

| tines be indicated cecurred in May 1944, then in July 19¢h, and even

4m Augest louk. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story tothered hie;
as it was obvious to the undersimed that Subject had somewhere become

n. Upon his discharge, he was returned to the Moscow area vhere
he was placed in a rest hac« (although Subject admitted thet there
really existed no need for this a: he taé¢ recovercd already prior
to his discharge), In continuing his narration, Subject iniicated
that the rest of his story "sowids very strange ani wbelievable"
but then averred thet <t was true. He states that, strange as it
appears and despite the shortage of Soviet nen at the time (1944)
be could not "find" himself a fob. Ee went to the MVD which did
offer kin a job in Veliki Luki on the higkvays with the ScpuzDo:

royekt ; however, he was not given the job by the officiais
responsible for this. As e result, he appealed directly to the
Minister of the MVD who “tried to intercede” in Subifect's tehalf.
Allegedly after he was given a full physical examination, he vas told
that he could not te essigned to the highwey units for reasons
which sere not spel sd out vo Susject.

0. Subject then "sought out" work with the Nauchniy Sovet with
no luck, Ee ultimately obtained a Job with the Moscow Sovet in the
Moscow Soviet Senicr Library (sic). in November 19:4, at a “salary
of $00 rubles, Subject began working in the field of “information
on municipal works—-highway construction, architecture, saczitation,
etc. Fis immediate suvervisor vas (‘nu) LIZS=0BV, the bead of
information departzent of the Pypire-2 Snercy ‘Rroject. Subject admitted,
in reply to the undersigmed‘s Guery, that nis vork vas “unusual”

for several reasons. First, he was paid a salary which was unusually. .

high end out of lire vith his qualifications. Secondly, though

paia a salary for a full-time job and position, he actuzily worked a
& part-time basis and was eble to come and so almost as he vished.
His work also included working on abstracts and translatiozs from
English to Russian, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction,
and hydraulics. .

Pp. In June 1949 subject states that be vas dismissed from the
foregoing position after he was given the explanation that the flow of
literature from the USA, which Subject was translating, hs¢ decreased.
In actual fact, Subject states, he was being “purged” because he vas
aJev. Ee then found a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete
plant where he vorked fron July 19:9 to 23 February 1950. Secause
be did not like that job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally
as a result of vhich, vithin less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4-5 _
different jobs. The positicus vere offered to him by the Moscow
Comittee of the CP to whos “Stalin hsd forvarded the letter". In
reply to my query, Subject admitted that he was not concerned that,
by vriting to Stalin, be would come to the attention of the Soviet
punitive organs, MVD/MGB, which would undertake to investigate his
case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject was given a Job as an

that bis relations vith his vife went from tad to worse end ultimstely

1950 or 1951. Hovever, vithin less than one month of their carriage,
Subject divorced her as he found out that she vas a “tad person" and
because he "had falies blindly in love" vith ker. (HOTE: This aspect
of SutJject's story ¢isturbed him very much. He was wisure of Limsel*,
wes vegue on dates, cetails, specifics, names, etc. It was again
obvious that Subject was less than frank exc open aboct this aspect ©
of his beckgrouné. Zs narration did not sommd convincing to Sudject
hinsot? yhen he began talking about "falling blindly in Love", etc.)
In 1952 he begen living with ancther womens, .

re In ca 1954 (dates vazue) Subject entered the Institute of
Marxisn-Leninism an? continued his studies for three or more yearee
Though be registered for the evening sessions, he deveted a good
portion of his days to study. As 8 result, Subject sgain admitted
to the undersigned tast he actually was ins unique position of being
able to do alxost as te “wished and desired” although ostensibly be
was a full-time exployee of the Bauman District Road Departwent. While
a student at the Institute of Marxisc-Leninism, Sudject sad his wite
began submitting spplications for a visa wo visit Sudject's parents
in the USA. In actual fact, Sudject states, bis real purpose in
spplying for the visa was to "defect" upoa bis arrival in the USA.
In February 1955 Subject states that be was “fired” from his Job
with the Bauman District because of “political unrelietility”. Hevever,
Subject admitted to the undersigned that the real reasoa for dismissal

must kave been otherwise as, had be actually been dismissed for
“political unreliability", ke would not have been able to continue
his studies at the Institute cof Mercien-Leninion.

8. Because Subject had carmmicated to his father, using
“hidden phrases” in their letters ts each other, about his wish to
leave the USER, Subject's father arrived in the USSR in 197 in
order, Subject states, "to esteblisz at first hand for hizsel?”
whether Subject really wished to “cefect to the U5A". Sudsectts
father remained in tae USSR for e total of 10 days. As a result
of hig father's visit, Subject Caged | his tactics and tezan to
subeit epplications for “immigration” to the USA. As eariter, these -

t. After he left the Rauwzan District place of exployment in
February 1555, Subject founé wore as a "free, lance trenslater for

translation of Enslish lensuace sanmuets oa technical equirment.
Again, Subject edmitted that his work was “urusual™ as, in actual
fact, he spent 1-2 cays at work, spent the rest of his tine at hom,
and cevoted most of his time end exexpy to the studies at the
Institute of Marxism-Leniniss. Eis salary continued at 1100 rubles
per month.

uw. In August 1958 his work came to an end. Generally he
provided a contardictory acccurt in this respect. Initially he .
stated that the position had deen eliminated but then chanced this
story to state that he resiqmed in August 1955 as he voulz have had
to begin devoting his full tise to the vorx. In any case, his
Tesiguation generally coinc*ded with his completion of stixtes at
the Institute of Marxisn~leninisz. ‘Thereafter, and umil his
imxigration to the USA in.19%2, Sabject held no full tice job.
Konetheless, he states that be succeeded in earning no less than
about 11CO rubles rer rauth by working as a free lance trenslator
for the Torgovaya Palata of Mosccw. Ee turned over to the undersigned

genuine or legitizate clain to American citizenship. 43 a result,
Subject is miusually sensitive to this topic.

Se CORLISICN:

a. In the opinion of the undersigned, Subject should ao} be
consideres for either ASSCHZ2N cr AMEXFLORS despite tke fact both
bis Pnglish and Russisn are native.

be m the basis of the interview, the widersigned feels that,
Subject is lees then frenk and that be is prevaricating. Moreover,

i there exist inmuwerable itexrs in Subfect's tale which are indicative
both that he vorked as e rezrufted acent of tte KGB (axi its
predecesser orzanizations) fn the TESR amd thet he left the TScR only
through end with the intercession of the ECB.

6. It ehoild be uxterscom! that because of the umique und sensitive
cover used by the umersicned, no attempt vas made to resolve the varions
ceotradictions, to challense Subject on any of his statenents, or to
Ppursse certain points of their logical conclusicn. The foregoing was
ovteined in the form of en interview and mo real attempt could be made,
given the cover, to delve nore | Geeply into the suspicious aspects of

Subject's backercund.

Russian zgovernnent considered =e 35 a Russian citizen, even though rT
had never nandseé in an appiieation for Soviet citizenship. Due to this,
and because I was in a rush to leave the country, I atrived axmon a
Soviet foreign passport. In the U. S. Enbessy in Ecseow I filled in si-
xultaneously two applications for entry into the Ue Se. Ae t
dncigruat ang the other as an Acezican citizen. I received a:
