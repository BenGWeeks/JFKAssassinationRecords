INTRODUCTION

1. The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-
ments reported in“éther"thannels. “This will be the last of the opera-
tional reports forwarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of
developments to date. :

OPERATIONS

2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic
surveillance points (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against ‘the
MHHARSH installation. Operations: frem the KDLITERAL surveillancé
point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on ?/July,
and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date. Operations
from the KDABSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the
equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his

family accomplished the same date. =

ADMINISTRATION

3. Oliver J, MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for
inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.

PERSONNEL ~

4. Whe project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
Operated the KDLITERAL basehouse, KXDFACTOR-5 operated the KDABSINTHE
basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and -9. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in
their photo specialty since 1957.

5, KDFACTOR-2 will continue to reside in the KOLITERAL building,
as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in
December when he will move to new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL
building (MEXI-03, Unit 15) is part of the KDVAULT coxglex of build-
ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels. If this
occurs before December, KDFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.

6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDABSINTHE apart='
ment ofa 31 August. KDABSINTHE is located in a building owned by
KDABBEY who plans to dispose of his equity in the property in the
near future. :

PRODUCTION \
7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITERAL, through \
KDFACTOR~2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover~ .
age of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers, He provided an average of three rolls
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his!
visual observation of the target area.

8. KDABSINTHE: Operated by RDFACTOR=5,; KDABSINTHE produced an
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source. for
information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially |
"WOCORK~=type" persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR
was also our main source of information on MHHARSH license plates

and automobiles.

9. In addition, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both provided detailed
"attendance sheets” on all MHHARSH personnel. With the loss of this
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identity personnel assigned
to the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in
and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided
periodic photo studies of the NHHARSH installation itself with empha-
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi-
tions made to the communications antenna system,

OPERATIONS

1. The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside
administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate
case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-
sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo
product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now
been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery
to the consumer has been speeded up.

PERSONNEL

_ 3. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-
city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with
the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8
and -9, KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since

1957.

PRODUCTION

4. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound photo-

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual
observation of the target area.

5, KDABSINTHE: Crperated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced

100 rolls of film and ccntinued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-

“tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
weThis segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
“information on MHHARSH License plates and automobiles.

6. KDLITERAL and XDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
“attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH..installation or to monitor their daily movements and
activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic

ote studies of the MEHARSH installation itself with emphasis on

_ phi
- Beverage of any CcGnstructionchanges and any modification or additions

made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required, During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.

SECURITY REVIEW

7. There were no known problems. of security relating to the
project. In response to Reference B. request, we have reviewed all
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have
established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the
area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are
extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed. The assets
derive a substantial portion of their
employment and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional
safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either
segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.

8. The only termination of a project asset in recent years was
KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated amicably in March
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,
KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access
agents. KDFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of
friends, and on a number-of recent occasions he has been very helpful
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background

processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact
surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished
product was always accomplished by an outside case officer.

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of
their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met weekly
to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing
and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick-
ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs. Meetings with
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his
route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long
enough to pick up the ercduct, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at
the Station and have been forwarded to Headquarters on both KDFACTOR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-S‘s imme-
diate family and could be contacted through him using his emergency

pian.

, PROBLEMS

j 11. The only known problem cofnected with the project is a
‘product of mother nature which 18 threatening the effectiveness of
KDLITERAL coverage. Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel
planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to
the garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the
point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator, estimates he only

has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying
ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch

to Headquarters on the topic in the near future.

OPERATIONS:

1, The XDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of the project
until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the
Ops Support Section back to the REDTOP Section. At that time Timothy
H,. ARCHBCLD assumed the inside admiaistrative chores, and agent
meotings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.
_FERNALD who had previously handled the assets. When ARCHBOLD de-~
parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J, MANKUNAS assumed his responsi-
bilities. MANKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FERNALD left
on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project

assets in the future.

3, Processing of the photo product is now accomplished inside
the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU, KDFACTOR~1, who formerly did all
™“ the processing in an outside safehouse/darkroom, was terminated
amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility
was turned over to CHAUVEAU, The new arrangement has proven to be
more than satisfactory, Agent meetings have now been cut to a
minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery to the con-~

sumer has been speeded up considerably,

PRODUCTION

5, KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL, :
through KDFACTOR~2, continued to be the. source of within-the-compoun
photographic caverage of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers, He produced 76
rolls of film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily
visual observation: of the target area,

. 6. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced |
. 167 rolls of film and continued to be theprincipal source for infor-
. mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atton-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type” persons and political exiles,
This ‘segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
information on. MBHARSH license plates and automobiles,

-°.. 4, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
“attendance. sheets" on all: MHHARSH personnel, Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements and

activities,

SECURITY

8,. There were no known problems of security relating to the

_ project, The termination of KDFACTOR~1 should pose no security
problem: Contact was broken amicably, and it is highly probable
that he would be more than willing to help out again if his services
are needed, Of the remaining assets, all five have been SGSWIRLED
in the past. They derive a substantial portion of their livelihood
from their JKLANCE employment and would thus lose a great deal if
security factors ever necessitated a termination of their work for
us. As an additional safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE opera-
tions are compartmented from each other, and there has never been
any indication that either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's

existence.

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets,
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operatioa
of their respective base houses, Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met
weekly to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHS product for timely
processing and analysis by the Station, Meetings with KDFACTOR~2
are car pickups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs,
Meetings with KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the
morning along his route of travel to his overt pb, These meetings
last only long enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies,
and pay salaries, rents, utility bills, etc, Emergency Contact
Plans are on file at the Station and have been forwarded to Head-
quarters on both KDFACTOR-2 and -5, KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are
members of KDFACTOR-5's immediate family and could be centacted -
through him using his emergency plan,

PROBLEMS

during the repotting period,

REFERENCE: HMMA-39679, 28 october 1970 (Previous Operational Report)

GENERAL

1. The-KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the period to
support two visual and photographic surveillance points (KDLITERAL
and KDABSINTH) directed against the MHHARSH installation and to
support the related photo processing of the product.. - -

2. The Station is presently taking steps to terminate
KDFACTOR-1 the photo processor and move this phase of the operation

into the Station.

3. Primary responsibility for the operational and administra-
tive handling of Project KDFACTOR was transferred on 1 December 1970
to the Operational Support Section, and handling of the KDFACTOR
personnel was turned over to Howard T. BAGAUS on 2 December 1970.

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

. 4,  KDFACTOR-5: This agent is met by BAGAUS at 0800 each
Tuesday morning at one of four different sites near the Anillo
Periferico in Polanco, some three miles from the Station. The modus
operandi used with this agent is basically the same as previously
used by Bruce H. FERNALD. All meetings are held in the case efficer
ear, and after the meetings, KDFACTOR-5 resumes his trip to work.

5, KDFACTOR-2: He is mot at 1630 every Tuesday by BAGAUS. in
several new widely spaced sites. Modus operandi is basically the

same as that doscribed in the provicus operational report for
FERNALD, and after the meeting, KDFACTOR-2 proceeds to his cover

job.

6, KDFACTOR~1:
(vada round-a-bout route to a location s
KDFACTOR-1 medical office; where he leaves his
office (taking counter-surveillanco precautions on the way).
As FERNALD previously, uses the notional cover of oither a
pharmaceuticalsalesman for ‘tyaboratorios del Norte" or that of a
patient while waiting in the outer office. The waiting period
normally depends upon whether KDFACTOR-1 is in at the time, or
whether he is in the middle of an operation at the hospital..
mittance to the KDFACTOR-1

pe (Waiting periods vary from immediate adi
@ average period is about twenty

office to several hours). Th
minutes. A decision was reached in the Station to terminate this
asset and to transfer this phase of the operation to the Station

itself, in the interest of speed, security, and cost. This
-termination is planned for early March 1971, at which time, the
processing will be done in the {tulion.

7. There have been no known security problems during this

reporting period. i

PRODUCTION - :

8. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL

through KDFACTOR-2& has again been the principal source of within-the-

compound photographic coverage ef PCS and TDY MHHARSHERS producing
dod covered, a great change of PCS

129 rolls of film. During the per
personnel at the MHHARSH instal}.ation took place, and KDLITERAL
played a leading role in assisting the Station in identifying the

new members of the installation, through not only photographic

coverage, but through detailed visual reporting also. In addition

to reporting on the activities ef the different individuals in the
ted on significant

target installation, KDLITERAL 188 also repor
yound such a recent change in the

construction changes in the comp
oof of the main building, During

antenna configurations on the r
this period, KDLITERAL has been specifically targetted against
AEJEFE, on whom which a special report has been submitted.

9, KDABSINTH: Operating through KDFACTOR-5, KDABS INTH
produced 158 rolis of film. It provided the Station with information
on visitors to the MHHARSH instgllation, giving special attention
to visits of "WOCORK-type" perscnt: KDABSINTH continues to fulfill
requirements from the various sections of the Station who have
requested fixed surveillance of political exiles, otc., to determine
jf these individuals are in cont®ct with the MHHARSH installation.
This segment of KDFACTOR contind®s to be the main source of
information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles,

10. Both KDLITERAL and KDAES INTH continued to provide detailed
“attendance sheets” on all MHHABSH personnel. In addition, they
provided reports on the activitseS and associates of IDENTITY who
was on TDY in Mexico from 15 october through 4 November 1970.
During this period both units wéFe also involved in surveilling

the movements of an AEKICK techician, (201-838166) who periodically
makes trips to other Latin Amers#¢20 countries on short notice.

the MHHARSIT installation and it is owned by LIMOUSINE,

property, Please seo HMihe83814,. 8 January 1968, for

except in special cases when’ prints are required
-quickly and are précessed within the Station. LIEMPTY-4
has a darkroom located in ‘the rear of: his medical
office and he handles the work after normal office

hours. with patients,

. ' 2. Outside case officer Bruce H, FERNALD handles the three
key agents of the Project (LIEMPTY-9, 713, and -:4). He meets
with each once a week’ for passing requirements, paying agent

and sub-agent salaries, rents and other experses, providing
.supplies; and retrieving the product. Inside case officer
Timothy M. ARCHBOLD handles the internal administration of the
Project and is the Station contact with FERNALD,

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

3. LIEMPTY-13: He is met by FERNALD i1 the early hours
.of Tuesday mornings at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from
the basehouse, LIEMPTY-13 parks his car and walks through a
central park on Calle Horacio where he is intercepted within
a ten-block distance by FERNALD, driving his car. During a
drive together, instructions and product are passed hetween them
and, once a month, LIEMPTY-13 is paid his salary and the
salaries for LIEMPTY-14, -26 and -27, After drop-off LIEMPTY-13
returns to his car and proceeds to his full-time job, thus
avoiding any direct route back to the basehcuse operation,

4, LIEMPTY-9: After completing his strveillance workday
from 0800 to 1500 hours, he completes his written reports and
drives to meet FERNALD at around 1630 hours, also on Tuesdays.
The location of car mectings varies but remzins within a quiet,
fairly secluded section, After leaving FERMALD, LIEMPTY-9
proceeds to his cover job at a brother's automobile dealership
for the remainder of his day, again avoiding any direct route
from FERNALD back to the basehouse, : :

5. LIeMPTY-4: After receiving the unsrocessed take from
LIEMPTY-9 -and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions, as suggested
by log entries that accompany the take, and goes to, LIEMPTY- 4's
medical office waiting room in the late afternoon. For these
meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pharmaceutical salesman or
a patiént and gets to see LIEMPTY-4 only after all other visitors
have departed. At cach meeting, FERNALD delivers films from
both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing anc retrieves the
processed take that, he had left the week before. While this
arrangement means that some of the product (those photos taken
soon after meeting with LIEMPTY-9 and -13) are almost two weeks
old when received at the Station, we have ast fotind this to be
- unacceptable, When speed is of the essence in special
circumstances, the Station WOACRE technician can handle the
processing,

7. During the ‘period of this report, LIEMPTY-4 processed.
approximately 142 rolls of 36-exposure film. Roughly one-third
_comes from, LICALLA and the remainder from LILYRIC which

2. As tar as the security problem is coacerned, the generous
termination settlement avarded to GUKENUE has probably removed
whatever small temptation there may have been on his part to be
indiscreet about his former assoecirtion, Although GERENDE his
certain character weaknesses which’ emérged as a lack of dedication
and a fveling that he could get by with as Littke work as possible,
the Station believes that he is basically not.an irresponsible
person, and that he realizes not only that he has an obkigation to
respect security, but that ho also realizes that ho has been treated
fairly and with great patience. He has offered his services for
the future, and he was told that we appreciated the offer and did
fot want to lose complete touch with him, but for now he should

devote himself to getting a good job,

3. As for GERENDE's wifo,. LIEMPTY-19, she also appeared to
be grateful for the termtnation bonus which she had been granted
(and which she was told had not been carved out of what was due
GERENDE). On the other hand, She has less reason to be toyal to
JKLANCE, and her mental stability if somewhat opea to question,
Therefore, she poses'a greater threat to LIEMPTY security than
dues GERENDE. At the same time, shc knows much less about Station
operations and personnel than does GERENDE. Furthermore, it is
not likely that she would (a la Mrs. LIROCKET-1) go directly to
the MHHARSHers with her information. What she might do is reveal
to her lawyer that GERENDE iad worked for LNPURE and therefore had
incone to which she might feel that shé is entitled. Since
GERENDE is no longer employed and therefore no longer has regular
“income (except for monthly payments of the termination bonus,
which she has agreed in writing not to claim), this threat has
also been lessened. Theoretically, however, she could expose
LIEMPTY and LIFEAT techniques (since she has been a LIFsAT trauscriber)|,
put she could not, as far as we knew, expose any currently enployed
agents, with the exception of LIEMPTY-4, who is married to GERENDE's
sister. (None of the above assessment uf the possible security
threat posed by LILMPTY~19 is changed by her 8 July visit to

JKLANCE Headquarters.)

_LIEMPTY Progress Report 1 November 1969 - 25 March 1970

* TACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES, ;

Reference: HMMA-38119, 18 November 1969! PRIORITY
SUMMARY

1. The LIEMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence fron
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H, “GERENDE, as well as the
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERENDE's
marital problems, Bruce H. FERNALD has been handling all Project
personnel since early December 1969, when GERENDE was deactivated
and placed on half-pay. No problema have resulted from this, other
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE was). The security

- threat will remain as long as GERENDE's estranged wife has it
within her power to’expose GERENDE'S RVROCK connection and the type
of worh he was engaged in, She has continually promised not to do
this, and thus far she has kept her word,

2. The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the
Station, It continues to play an important CI role (particularly
for LNEPGO and LNREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station
is concerned, is in the positive field, Two recent examples
underline this; The early .(and thus; far only) debriefing of
AEMIDRIFF was accomplished almost exclusively by showing her photos
of all MHHARSH Exbassy personnel and getting from her a character
sketch on each individual. These photos were all obtained by
LILYRIC and LICALLA, Secondly, LIEMPTY observations (as opposed to

during tho recedt opérational activity undertaken against AESKASICK,
In short, LIEMPTY remains a highly effective and highly useful
Support asset, whose product’ is obtained in order to be used
operationally, not simply collected for the files,

GERENDE

3. The GERENDE problem is unquestionably a serious one. We
are forwarding under separate cover copies of several memoranda
Prepared by. GERENDE, One outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a

‘third outlines proposals for a-settlement. There is no hope of

reconciliation, The Statioa’s position with GERENDE from the
start’ has been that he must agree to an amicable settlement with

his wife in order to -insuré that She. would not feel forced to take
steps which would jeopardigé the security of Station operations,

‘For this ‘reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any

financial settlement with his wife would have to take into accouat
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary our of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that

salary. GERENDE's wife was made aware of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement

was strictly informal, The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to use his RVROCK salary as a -weapen in the dispute with his
wife, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to refrain
from exposing his connect ions, Indeed, events have shown that
GERENDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear
to her that she, as well as GERENDE, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for
his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely
out of the picture, Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station
position wag fair, and he said he would conform.

4, The attached memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station.
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the
doubt, largely because her description of GERENDE's character
weaknesses came -as no surprise (particularly his tendeacy to
procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake), Early in the
conflict, LIEMPTY~19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about GERENDE's salary. She was told
she could not.mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,
and that if she told anyone-that GERENDE had any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GERENDE would be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

: meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the

level of GERENDE's overt income (GERENDS's monthly salary from
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which

he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly). .
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he

would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts

doubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and
more unreasonable, GERENDE was moving in the othor direction,

5, The outcome can still not be predicted. As can be seen
from GERENDE's memos, the two sides are still far apart on a number
_of points, including specifically money, LIEMPTY-19 insists on
10,000 pesos per month. GERENDE is willing ‘to pay 5,000. GERENDE
is currently on half-pay, Which means that his total’ (all source)
monthly income is around 14,000 pesos, From this, he would not only
-have. to pay the amount which is finally agrecd upon, he must also
cont true ‘payments of 2500 pesos per month to LIEMPTY~19's father
(paying off a loan obtained to build‘their house), The complicating
“factor is. the unce rtainly of GERENDE's future with RVROCK, The
Station has ied for some time that it is impossible to
continue to pa: ERENDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
and LILYRIC basehouges. Now that FERNALD has absorbed this duty
_ With only small inconvonicnce.and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even lIe@ss sense to put GERENDE to work only to do this, GERENDE
has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and
prior to the current pereonal crisis he had been told that he
would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
to retain hie position. As Headquarters is aware, he had been
given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE's
ability, As we have previously stated, he is personablo, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had good training and experienca
in certain fields, On the other hand, there has long been doubt
about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition.
The “reversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached --
memos, which took placo when he was confined to his home as an .
LP keeper, did more than cause domestic problems -- it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago.

6, The. question which must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE. He can be useful to the Station, but
the tation has learned to get along without him. What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knowledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference, If all of this were blown,

the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations -
against the MHHARSH target, would be considerable, The Station

does not believé that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIEMPTY-19 might do, particularly
since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, having already

lost a possible source of income through the termination, GERENDE's
termination’ bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars, Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that

he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never been mentioned,

LICALLA

7. The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changes,
except for the fact that Bruce H,. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9
Since 9 December 1969, Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are held once
a week at pre-arranged times and places (weil away from the MHHARSH
area), Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by
FERNALD, if special coverage is desired (as in the AESEASICK case,
for example). There have been no problems, operational or personal,
involving the basehoise or LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period,
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested. This
"special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected
individual -- who does he spend his time with, how is he behaving,
when was he present (or absent), etc. LIEMPTY~9 spends over 40

- an fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,

asked to report on the arrival and activities of TdYers such as
the AFKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that i
“security inspectors" are expected -- he is told of the expected “4
arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor or newcomer immediately),
the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attempt to H
-identify, at least by association, the person who went out to meet :
an LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970). The
value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely

be overstated,

LILYRIC

8. There have been no changes during the reporting period of
the operation of the LILYRIC basohouse activity, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from
GERENDE in early December, FERNAID normally meets only LIEMPTY-13,
at pro-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MHHARSH
area), once a week for pick-up of the films and reports, He occae
sionally meets LIEMPTY-14 (LIEMPTY-13's wife) when LIEMPTY-13 may
be out of town, The LILYRIC coverage is a fanily enterprise ‘
with the work equally divided among LIS\©TY-15, 44,6, and 27,
who split up the hours of.duty so that there is uninterrupted

, coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0S00 to 1800 hours, and

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays, (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may
be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to
the Station request for such extra coverage during the AEMIDRIFF
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy, Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of MHHARSH officials,
up-tc-date recording of MHIARSH license ounbers, special activities
and visitors (perticularly Americans, of when five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting period), and some 3,500 photographs,
As an example of the value of LILYRIC coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MHHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting all of Mexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to
the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbers
{along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among
other things, this enabled tho Station to identify AESEASICK's
companions during his iast few days-in Mexico, Without LILYRIG
identificationof the new license plates would have taken months and
would have handicapped our operations. LILYRIC has also provided
special coverage.of the visit of a Latin American CP representative,
and is currently watching for the two AEXICK security technicians,
201-314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent, Also,
LILYRIC has reported on visits of Mexican stixdents and the identity
of the MHHARSH representatives who deal with them or hand out
literature to them, In short, LILYRIC's services, even though the

MHHARSHers undoubtedly assume we have a LILYRIC=Like facility, and
act accordingly, are another vital clement of the REDTOP program,

LIEMPTY-4
9, LIENMPTY-4, has continued to develop and to print all of

the LICALLA and LILYRIC photographs. He has been met regularly by

Bruce H. FERNALD (taking ‘over for GERENDE) since 26 Novomber 1969,

The firdt few medtings at that time (late November and early

December) were arranged by EERNALD by telephone to LIEMPTY-4 and

| primarily concerned LIEMPTY-4's reports on GERENDE's family problens
-and related security arrangements, Since mid-December, LIEMPTY-4 *
resumed a regular. schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at
pre-arranged. sites’ and times. LIEMPTY-4 has been given a special
extension inthe Station to which he may call as "Dr, Carlos" to
‘leave a message ‘for "Victor™ (FERNALD),. FERNALD can change meeting
plans by directly calling LIEMPTY-4, The only personal problem
directly involving LIEMPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required
his wearing a full cast on his leg for over six weeks, During
this period. when LIEMPTY-4 has been unable to drive, FERNALD has
been mecting LIEMPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films
and prints, at LIEMPTY~4's office, under a suitable pretext and with
appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY~4's services are
invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis,

process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab,

SECURITY

10, Other than the security problems inherent in GERENDE's
personal problems, there have been no security problems during the

reporting period,

FUTURE PLANS

11, As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated, “This is not an easy decision to make,
nor will it be easy to confront GERENDE with this decision, He
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK. However,
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able
to get along without his services, Furthermore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk,
To try to molify her by promising ‘her a portion of his salary is
probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened, The Station, therefore,
intends to terminate GEREND& prior to the end of FY 1970, GERENOE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary: per
full year, This would come to $8,750 (USD), For various reasons,
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD), Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of
the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows,
she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herselt, The
Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound from
a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has
earned for this purpose, Therefore, while tho figure will remain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable amount, Total obligations for FY 1970 in
the LIEMPTY Projecl are currently estimated at slightly leas than
$33,000 (USD). The Project has been approved in the amount of
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD), It
is therefore requested that the LIEMPTY Project be amended for
FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

12. ° Regarding the project’ renewal for FY 1971, as far as
LICALLA, LILYRIC, and LIEMPTY-4 are concerned, ao changes in
procedure are planned, The product is useful, it is as timoly a8
present: circumstances permit, and the personnel involved are doing’
their jobs well, The only change foreseen is an increase in
salary for some, if not all, of these agents. The most recent.
Salary increases took effect .1n May 1968, LIEMPTY=4 has not had

an increase since
Increase in cost of living alone would be sufficient justification
to raise salartes, but in the case of these agonts their consistently

excellent work\deserves to be rewarded, ‘These salary increases
will probably range between 10 and’ 20 percent.

‘te LIEMBRACE effective 1 July 1970, Real estate expenses should
remain fairly constant, with perhaps a slight allowance for
inflation, .The rent on GERENDE's dark room (HEXI 137) will no
longer be paid’with his termination. MV-2823 will be sold or

personal and private life over vecent years,
Known some of tho facture that have, from my point of view,

up to the present situation,

2, I realize that the interests of the organization and the

interest of the tndividuals who may huve opportunity to come ino
contact with my case Gictate as Little personal involvement as .
possible tn the lives of agents, Indeed, the requirements of .

‘ security, compartnentation and efficiency prescribe the modue

, operandi and, to a great extent the wnodus vivendi, of agency
personnel net only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
life, the better, but, as the years ge by, changes may occur which
go unreported or unneticed and which may bring about unexpectud
events and revercussions. When a person han been working for the
Station, as J have, ‘or 1ifteen years with little or no personnel
nandling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
job, and somecthtng coaes up like the abrupt separation of my
wife (LISMPTY~-19) and re with the persoual and potentjal security
visks it has entatled, J feel that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, 1 would like this explanation te reach not
only my present case officer and Chiet of Station but also the
former Chief and officers with whom I have had the privilege to

work over the years,
3. YY would like to give thanks, in advance, for the patience

apd understanding that have been shown me thus far, Whatever the
final outcome, 1 know that pecple have been bending over backward

to be helpful "and patient in hopes of an early solution to the
conflict.

spacious, carpeted, furnished apartment near the DIZTAG kmbassy,
which served intermittently as a listening post-basehouse for the
agency, At the time, LIEMPTY-19 was working as the manager of the
boekstore at the University cf the Americas and, at the seme time,
studying for.a B,A, in philosophy, Thos. were happy times. We

“received a twoevonth leave, went to Europe, the Rome Olympics and

visited LIEMPTY-19's family in Holland, Back in alexico, when the

. base was in operation EF stayed heme a lot (one of the rewuirenents),

minded the dial and tave recorders and the baby -= an unfortunate
reversal of marital reles. After exactly five years the basehouse
was closed down and we lost rent, LIEMPTY-19's salary and my
mother's salary which she had been receiving as part-time basehouse
keeper, My mother and youngest sister gave considerable help in
taking care of the baby while LI“MTY-19 worked and when we went
to Furope and left the baby with then, This was during the first
three years at the base until we had our second child, Christopher,

5. We moved to a small apartment in Lomas and, to supplement
the loss cf salary aad rent alleuwance, the Station began paying
1,000 nesos a month fer the use of a dark room T had built or the
roof of the building, We had wr third child, Madeleine, unplanned,
two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment, The
apartment need not have been 50 Small hut we had chosea it for its
Lecation and style and because it was to be a temborary stop until
we could find something better, We missed roing to the Olympics
in Tokyo which we had planned to do (1964) and instead began
negotiating to buy a home brilding site at Rio Escendido Lut whea
the deal fell thrmgh, we decided to go on leave to Eurove again,
this time with the two older childven, leaving the baby with my
sister, We visited with LISMPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had
moved back to Holland after having lived in Washington, D.C., since
1943) and the two children stayed with them while LIEMPTY-19 and I
made Side trips, Traveling is LIEMPTY-19's greatest love in life,
Upon our return to Mexico (I came back twe weeks earlier), LIEMPTY-19
was so depressed at leaving Kurope and being back in Mexico she was
enotionally and physically inaccessible for avout six weeks, She
nad not fully adjusted to living ia Mexico or to settling down and
becomiag a housewife, Our cramped quarters, way of livitig, lack
of moaey, my job, my irregular hours and habits, my Friday night
poker games, the three children, all these got her dewn,

6. In the fall of 1965 after our return from Furope I began
terching English to beginners in the adult education program at the
American School in the evenings, This started as a two-hour a
week meonlighting experiment but by early 1966, through student
contacts made at the school, I had branched ovt te teaching at the
offices of Carnation Milk Co,, Singer Sewing Machine, and
Richardson-Merrell Drug Co, (cr a total of about tweaty hours per
week, LIEMPTY-19, meantime, was working part-time at the Hamilton
School in Lomas where the two older children were attending. The
family finances improved and I was able to convince LIEMPTY-19 that

the best thing to do vas-to invest in land and build a house big
enough for our growing, family which by now had a fourth child on

the way. With three friends as partners, I entered on a land~buying
deal which turned out to be complicated’ as we bought the land in

the form of company stock, The company was liquidated and the
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners, I paid for
our share with tae praceeds fran the sale of a small lot I had been
paying for since.1955, LIEMPTY-19 was at first reluctant to tie

us down with a house but when we finally got the papers and land
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeherrtedly into the .
broject and the building which began in August 1967, While LIEMPTY-19
fFupervised the construction, I worked during Septeriber and October
almost full-time for the Oly:;npic Organizing Committee and the group
Zrom Czechoslovakia which came tv train in the pre-Olympics, My
father-in-law deposited money ‘n sexico to help us with the majov
part of the financing of the house. We ured $286,500 pesos of his
morey and about $60,000 that LIEMPTY-19 and i had saved and got the
house tinished enough to move in in March 1968. We were very short
on furniture und shortly after moving in bought three bedroom sets,
an autonatic washer and even a piano, Naturally, cash was svacce,
dirt was plentiful, The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
work had just begun, there were no closets, the house was unpainted,
Theveaster, we did things on the tucuse as the money came in:
continued with carpentry, finished the driveway, put in grass,

nuilt a fence and front gate.

7. Six months after moving in came time for the Olympics and
¥ worked, unolficially taois time, with the water polo team from
Australia, Liewpry-19 worked for the month with the Dutch and
Belgian radio aud TY group. LIeMPTY-19 vas, once again, caught up
in the atmesphere of being among Europeans and doing something
exciting and out of the routine of home aud children, She ‘fell in
love with the Australtiars as well, and for several months all she
eceld talk of was that we should move to Australia, I gave it some
thought but decided that we had neither the money to invest nor the
youth and technical training to make it as pioncers “down under"
and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and job seniority

here in Mexice.

8, Toward the end of 1068, LIENPTY-19 decided it was time for
me to move out of the master bedroom as she could no loager: face
that aspect of oux married Life, For several months we tried this
but it did not werk out fer ne, CUne night in March 1969 af'ter we
returned home from a party, she asked me to help her undress and
when she, once again, refused to have aaythiag Co de with me, I
got rough with her, prompting a decision on her part, which she
had already been pondering, to visit her parents in Holland as soon
as possible, Her father provided the plane fare and she! left in
April for the United States to visit hex brother and sister and
Holland, for what she said would be a five week trip, She ‘stayed
heady ten weeks, The four children remained with me, the, maid, and

my sether who came to -heip three days a week, Upon her return,
ULIAPTY-19 bore an atr of resignation rather than of enthusinemand,

“again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down

end sentally unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia
she said that it she had wanted to live in Australia, she should
have married an Australian. The separation Fad not improved our
intinate relationship,

9. In Avgust I was to take fite weeks’ leave and £0 with the
childrea to Astro-World in tiouston aad visit my mother’s family in
South Cavoliaa, When [ suggested postponing making monthly payments
on her father's loan until Deceaber when the Christmas Sonus would
cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she vas adamant,
saying that if I did net have the cash for going, I should not take
leave. I borrowed from my iife insuraace pulicy and left with the
three youngest children, Adriana had a touch of aepatitis and
joined us three weeks later. After spending the month in South
Carolina, we returned to Mexico to find that LIEMOTY-19 had very
much enjoyed her solitude, ‘We had already talked about divorce before
her trip to Holland in the spring. I had told her that [ would not
ecorsider parting with the children and she said she would consider
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well
aS give her a Substantial share of what She considered was her part
of the house. The title of the house was in my name and had been
Since the buying of the land. LISMPTY-19 Mid I could mortgage or
sell the house but that ihe money was what she was mainly interested
ia. I told her that the sale of the house was not finarcially
wise in its unfinished state and that the house and land are very
Likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years
coasidering the housing developments going on in the area, Added
to this was the sentimenta] attachment to the house and area, A
mortgaze, on the other hanc, for the amount of her father's ican
plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering
the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in Mexico,

10. At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going
through the above-meationed discussions, LIEMPTY-19 was taking a
course at Japan Airlines to become a tour guide ard group leader
for trips to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, certainly,
te Expo ’70 in Osaka during the spring and summera 1970. Fhe
received a diploma to that effect. I told her th.t if she wanted
out cf the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all
right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would
continue to repay hey father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month
and 5 percent per year). She then sought Jega) advice frou an old
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, in turn, steered
her to a young woman lawyer, Dra, Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LIENMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way
to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to
hang on to the children because LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concevning them and she now said that she could not

“abandon the children, I refused to visit her lawyer with her

‘ saying J was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said

that her :aind was made up and that we would have to split up,
\

11. Things came to a head on the night of 12 Noverber whea I
got home arvund 9 PM and she suggerted we have a drink and talk
things over, I mixed Some martinis and she began laying down the
terms under which she thought we should get divorced, i.e. I sould
move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money,
grant her custody of the children and support of 2,000 pesos per
tionth per child ($8,000). I said I would not get divorced under
those conditions and we discussed anJ argued in the kitchen for about
three hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process. We went
upstairs’ and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
I would not Ict her do. She got hysterical, phoned a neighbor,

Uta dz la Hoz, then she vent into the front yard and awakened the
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
their hcuse. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillermo
came and LIEMPTY-19 went with them to their home two blocks away,
About a half-hcur later I walked up to Uta's to ask LIEMPTY-19

to come home but wes told that she was busy phoniug her lawyor

and would not veturn,

12, The following morning I tvok the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcia (LIEMPTY-4's wife) picked them up ard
took them to her house where I joined them for lunch, LisNPTY-19
came by in the late afternoon while my sister was cut, picked up
the children saying she was taking them home, tailed to do so, then
disappeared and was not to be found,

13, It was the subsecuent action taken by LIEMPTY-19 in
dropping her lawyers and taxiag on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
potential security hazatds that ensued,

To : Case Officer
FROM GERENDE
SUBJECT: GERENDE Status Report

The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and
his wife (LISMPTY-19) is as follows:

1. GERENDE is living at his mother’s apartment at 99 Carlos
B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9, He has rented a three-bedroom
Apartment at Tornel 2 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where

; he-has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his

former address at Ladera 39, Lomas de Bezares.

2, The house at Ladera 39 is reated to an executive of
Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,
and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality. The
monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,

beginning 1 February 1970,

3. LIEMPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still
living at the residence of the Netherlands’ Ambassador, Barcn
Schelto Van Heemstra at Pefia 360, Jardines del Pedvegal, It seems
fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and. Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
two occasions he has seen them, They have been there since
5 December 1969. LIEMPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed address
and says that she is staying with "friends,"

4. LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe
Juardo as her lavy: : and, through him, is pressing for even more
advantageous terms in the. divorcee than she had asked in November,
Please see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal

made by Juardo on 4 March 1970,

5. The charges and accusations made by LIEMPTY-19 against
GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

- @. Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge
rests at the 5° Juzgado Penal, 2° Corte Penal located at

we. pee

Lecumberri. “The judge is CRUZ Mellado. These charges have
not, been pressed since thoy were originally made on 13 November

71969 Dy LIEMPTY-I9. The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 24 Corte

Penal composed of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Juzgados Penales. The
judge of the 6° Juzgado is Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of

“GERENDS's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON, Together they have,

en two occasions, been to speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado who
agreed not to: “issue an arrest warrant ani who has, finally,
called for a ‘hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
10:00. MAGALLON has given GERENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed,

b. Fraud <-- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969, the day after GERENDS left the
Villa Obregon jail after having spent a weok there for :
disobeying a court order. (The court order ‘had consisted of
an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house
and to have LIENPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as
the temporary custodian of the children, GERENDE refused then
admissbn under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,
on the spot, a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge,
LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
as incompetent. The judge-has had to face charges of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.
Magallon and Jurado, The charge of fraud rests at Mesa 31°
of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal, The Public Ministry
Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy
the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under

“ the separate property marriage clause lad wrongfully placed
-.the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.

Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christmas 1965
in a complicated transaction involving three other partners:
Robert Bancroft WHITEHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and James
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property

in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their
Spouses,.- Later the land was subdivided and after nineteea
months the deeds were issued, LIEMPTY-19 supervised and prodded
the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware
that the preperty was in GERENDE's name, In August 1967 when
construction of the house began, LIEHPTY~19's father's money
was used which he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose,
Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreement, GSRENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it,

GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")
pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts

_ Showing up to date payment of the loan at the "Mesa 314,"
No further action has been taken by LIEMPF Y-19 or her lawyer
on this matter but the charge has not finally been settled and
is still pending. The charge is, of course, unfounded and is
awaiting the proper "lubrication" in order to be filed away,

- C, Neglect -- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 in ©
December 1969 at the 7° Juzgado Mixto de Paz claiming that
GERENDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 and the children to their fate
and that they were utterly destitute. GERENDE was not
notified of.this chacge and on 9 February after attending a
hearing at.the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on
the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GERENDE, took
him to the Procuraduria and from there to Lecumberri, This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged, The
following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman)
formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidence. GERENDE and
Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and
see if Jurado had appealed but he had not and, apparently,

that matter is closed,

6. On 14 Novembor 1969, one day after LIEMPTY-19 disappeared
from home taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges
against her for minor lesions and showed. medical proof thereof,
The hearing of 9 February after which GERENDE was detained, was
called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilito SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,
ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-ia

once a week,

7. \LIEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri.Street in San Angei Inn, The two older children
are going to school there, During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
school, -On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30
to try to speak to LIEMPTY+19 and see the children, LIEMPTY-19
has objected to this and the meetings Imve been short and fruitless
except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's, GERENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).

8. After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the
divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case
went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judges,
in turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come
to reside at the Ist Juzgado Civil in the D,F, The judge is Olda
CORREA (woman) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty
straight. Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce
suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated
on GERENDE's part. LIEMPTY-19, on the otheriand, has not had



--- Page 57 ---

" Sate: vb,

GERENDE served with papers though his current address is known,
apparently because she is still seeking a voluntary divorce along ~
the lines and terms which are stated in the accompanying set of
proposals. GERENDE cannot begin to accept these proposals in
their-present form as they are patently unfair and hardly a point
to beg ianing bargaining from.

8 March 1970

The following proposals were made to GERENDE on 4 March 1970
(Monday) by LIEMPTY-19's lawyer, Bernabe Jurado, through a mutual

to live, in the company of her four children, both parties agree
that the household effects will be turned over by GERENDS, to
LIEMPTY-19 for that purpose, as well as the automobile she has been

using throughout the marriage,

ACTION REARED - SEFERENCES,

SUMMARY

“. 1, There has been no change in the operating procedures of
the two LIEMPLY base houses, LICALLA and LILYRIC, or in the use
“made of the product, Raymond H, GERENDE continues as Project
principal agent, and renewed attempts have been made to broaden his
activities, to include additional agent nandling and the following
up of ops leads, After a slow start, some progress has been made,
;but GERENDE is now involved -in divorce proceedings with his wife,
[|raie situation is steadily worsening and represents a potential
Usecurity risk to LIXSMPTY and other Station operations,

GERENDE

2. As Headquarters is aware, the Station has for some time .
tried to get additional mileage out of GERENDE. The Station has
long recognized GERENDE's not inconsiderable talents; He is personabid,
fluent ia two languages (to the point where he can pass either as a
Mexican or an American with no trouble), he has considerable
experience in support activities, he has knowledge of the local
scene which would be hard to duplicate, and he is completely at the
Station's disposal, He has also worked for RVROCK for close to
15 years, in effect making a career of RVROCK, and the Station
believes that this long period of service imposes on RVROCK an
obligation to see that he is fairly treated and provided with benefits
which would not otherwise be due an agent with less longevity. On

{tne other hand, GERENDK has picked up some bad habits—-he is not
punctual, his written reports leave much to be desired, and worst, of
tall, he lacks drive and ambition, :

3. After several largely abortive attempts to get GERENDS to
follow up operational leads (and after noting, at the same time, a
fine job-he did-in recruiting LIRICE-13), the Station decided to
present GERENDE with what amounted to an ultimatum; Following a
six-week léave at the home of relatives in the US, he was told that
in recognition of his past services he was being given a salary
increase ‘to $7, 000 US per annum (which may not seem like much until
it is realized that’ GERENDE pays ro taxes on this, and has the use
of a QP car, to boot). He was also told that he would be given a
oumber of. leads to follow up (in some cases persons to whom he had
natural Access; in ‘other cases leads which he would follow up under

would be up to him-to take advantage of this opportunity to perform
up to his level of ability; if he did so, Headquarters would be
willing to work out an annuity program which’ would relieve his
‘worries about eventual retiresient. If he did not put out, he could
~—“expéct to be terminated by the end of FY 1970, GERENDE expressed
{> bis gratitude and his willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel,
, and, in fact, he has dofe.so. In October 1969 he took over the
handling “of LIANVIB-1-froa Oliver G. SCANTLING, and the Station hes
started to give him leads to follow up. His performance has improved
in every way--his punctuality hae improved, his written reports
are continually improving, and he has made the effort to devise
approaches to the various leads and to start to follow up on them,

4. The Station was therefore highly encouraged, until 24
October, when GERENDE reported that his wife wanted a divorce,
problem is basically one ot incompatibility of personalities,

. exacerbated by the fact that GERENDE's operational activities
resulted in his being home more often than a man who works a normal
office day, GERENDE's wife had taken a long vacation alone earlier
in the year, visiting -her parents, and the leave taken by GERENDE,
referred to above, followed his wife's return and did not include
-her. Both times GERENDE had the four children, Thus the news of

y the divorce request did not come as a real surprise. The problem,

however, is that both parties want custody of the children, and the
éy dispute becomes daily more bitter and more violent. The station

i has taken the position that security of GERENDE's operations must

Jj: jbe preserved at all costs, hoping, of course, that the divorce can
soe avoided, At this writing, the outcome cannot be guessed, If
ve the bitter fight results in the surfacing of GERENDE's RVROCK

ei employment, LILYRIC and LICALLA are faced with at least ame threat

* of exposure, ‘The MHHARSHers are quite aware that a LILYRIC-like

facility exists; whether they suspect LICALLA is a moot question,
LICALLA is in many ways more useful, and the MHHARSHers could put

it out of business very easily by making their wall higher, Little

could, or probably would, be done to prevent LILYRIC from functioning.

has been pretty much restricted to LIEMPTY, his knowledge of

is too early to judge the-outcome of GERENDE's problems, but the
Station is making every effort to see that security of operations
is not affected by whatever decision is reached,

In addition to previding about 3,500 photos during the reporting
period, as well as comments on events and relationships which are

_ be a useful tool in the Station's operations against the MHHARSH
target. One IA in the Station spends several hours per week processi
the take, keeping mug book and files up to date, checking the infor-
mation in the logs against other reports when required (to determine
whether or not an agent or contact entered the MEHARSH installation
as claimed; or whether an ARGRIP or AEKICK officer was out of the
installation at a particular time, etc.) and analyzing the- LICALLA
production for insight into personal relationships, Useful
by-products include continual up-dating of MHHARSH license plates
and observation of demonstrations outside of the Embassy and
renovations within the grounds, Furthermore, in GERENDE the Station
has been attempting to develop on outside asset with considerable
flexibility, who has beeu used to make recruitments and assessments
as well as handle agents, GERENDE's personal problems are placing
his own career in jeopardy and posea potential security hazard to
LIEMPTY and other Station operations. This is a problem which will
be dealt with and resolved in the next reporting period and prior

to the next Project re newal request. [”

2. Until the introduction of FERNALD, there was no change in
the meeting arrangements with GERENDe. Meetings were held on an
average of three times per week until October, when LIEMPTY-19
(GERENDE'S wite) was relieved oi the responsibility of transcribing
the Spanish-language portions of LIENVOY coverage of the BuDOX

3. GSRSNDE'S “agent handling: responsibilities within the LIEMPTY
project remain as greviously reported. He had also handled ERFAIN@Y

‘until the latter's termination in August yo’. He developed a good
relationship with EXFAIN-3, and he showed that he is quite capable,
with proper case o cer puldance, of providing usetul service to
the Station in the handling o1 agents beyond the support type to
which he had been limited in the past, The Station intends to try
to expand this role, with due regard for security and for GeRENDE'S
limited experience. Furthermore, the Station stili bas every
intention of using GERENDE selectively in cultivation and development
o4 operational leads, as Outlined in reference, No such leads were
found for GERENDE ducing the reporting period (among other reasons,
we have no intention o: giving GERENDH a lead simply for the sake of
giving him somethine to do), but as soon as a suitable lead is
uncovered, it will be passed. to GERENDE,

4. GXSRENDE was particularly useful during the Olympic period,

While he did not-get-a job with the Olympic Committee as he had

hoped, his wife was eaployed as a translator by the European televisio
networks who had cene to cover the games. This, plus other personal
contacts, gave GERINDE a certain amount ot access to Olympic facilitie
Both GERENDE and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of
AEEGGHEAD material, acd GERENDE performed a number of miscellaneous
tasks assisting the Station in various Olympic responsibilities,

5, GERENDYE has also been used in Support: of JMROD operations,

. Such as making mail pick-ups and delivering matertal and making phone
calls to AMBASSUON, Yollowing the Warsaw Pact Powers’ invasion ot
Czechoslovakia, GERENDE way asked to cover a demonstration in front
of the Soviet hmbassy, and he wrote a food report which was used in
tmbassy briefiags, Recently, GERENDE has enrolled at the
University of the Americas to work Jor an M.A, in contemporary
Mexican history. The Station will explore the possibility of his
getting access to persons or injormation of Interest on the University
campus,

LICALLA

G6. LIEMPTY-9's work (in the LICALLA base house) was inhibited
in July due to the construction of a maid's room near his working
quarters, During the reporting period, however, he took a total of
2,217 operational phetos. His regular reporting and commentary
continued as in the past. LIEMPTY-0 is a steady and dependable per-
former, and his unigue vantage point remains the source or tne most
iateresting and revealing phoics.as well as often very informative
reporting,

LILYRIC

. 7 LIEMPTY-18, -14, ~26, and -27 have been abie to keep the
LILYRIC base house manned on a regular basis from 0800 to 1800 hours
weekdays and OS00 te 1300 hours on Saturdays, with other hours cover-—
able upon request. Tnis has proven to be a iar netter arrangement
than depending on LINIT=D for some of this coverage, In addition to
the 6,753 operationsi photos taken during the reporting period and the
daily fixed snrveillasce reports, LILYRIC reporting is of considerable
help in compiling current vehicle and license plates lists, PCS arriva
and departures, unuszal activities such as. demonstrations cr protests,
unusual or lengthy atsences of personnel, etc., all of which have

{ obvious CI importance, It was LILYRIC photos which made it possible
17! for LNERGO to identizy the Subject of 201-841520, who had been in

il clandestine contact with AEGRIP officers. LILYRIC also reported on
a half dozen other American {or American appearing) visitors, some of
whom it was possible toe identify through tracing license plates,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, Diviston D ~- °°:
SUBJECT : Limesa/Limst ron

iz an .

1. Some attention should be devoted, if it has not already
been, to the dangers involved in this operation and particularly
to what countermeasures the target may institute, or may already
have instituted.

2. Ome current danger certainly exists, to wit, the exist-
ence of project Licalla base, which is in the group of buildings
comprising the Limesa complex. ne of the agents at Licalla
bese is known to one of the Lipstick agents arrested in the
summer of 1958, and it is, hence, possible that both the host
government and the target knows of Licalla. It is suggested
that perhaps Licalla should be terminated. ‘The reason has deen
advanced that this should not be done since the agent would be
suspicious and in any event Licalla might serve as a red herring
for Limesa. It is velieved that the Licalla agent could be
gotten out of this operation without arousing his suspicion. The
Station could mount an obvious tail on him; vhen he reported it,
he could be told he had probably been made and that, hence, the
operation should no longer continue. The asent has been a good
one and could be used elsewhere on some other work. Licalla
house is going to be repaired soon. This might be a good oppor-
tunity to stop work there and let same innocent party rent it.
That would be a better red herring.

3. Concerning the manner in which Limesa houses were acquired
by the Station, it should be kept in mind that the purchase mechanian
was identical with that used in Limited. The watchman at Limited
knew an American owned it and told this. to what to him must have
seemed a casual visitor to the premises when it was under repairs,
We should, therefore, assume the targets know an American owns it
and that it is blown. Therefore, we should also assume that if
the targets have conducted any sort of an investigation of Limesa
houses, they may well have discovered that the same ultimate owner
is involved. So far as is know, the bank which fronts for the
purchases has not been checked to see if any inquiries have been
“ made. We must agree the targets have the capability to find out
who the front owner is--the bank-- and from there could possibly
establish the identity of the omer, Limousine. Limousine and his
firms have also been. used as cover for other Station agents and
operations apart from Limesa and Limited.

ge

SG



--- Page 82 ---
14-0000

4, It should not be forgotten that a person tried both to
rent and buy Limesa properties earlier in the year after ve
owned them. So far as we know, a check on this person was not.
productive of suspicious data, but the question arises as to how
thorough the investigation was. Possibly the name the man gave
whén making {nquiries was false, meaning that in effect the right
pérson has never been invéstigated at all. Knowing that the ne
targets have in the past shown some interest in the Limesa build-
ings, it is not beyond the realm of reason that this man was sent
by them, The story he gave for wishing to rent the house--because
it was handy and close to a certain school--is identical vith the
story used by the Station to cover rental of Licalla almcst next

door.

5. Even granting that the true ownership of Limesa has not
been discovered by the targets, they have various recourses through which
to establish the identity and activity of the occupants thereof. The
following possibilities suggest themselves:

a. Enter into litigation with Limesa ower over exact
boundaries or other pretext, demanding property be
surveyed. On court order, Limesa could be inspected

thoroughly.

b. Undermine target side of Limesa walls, leading to
possible condemnation of property by local government
or necessity various repairs, etc.

ce. Sabotage of electricity (causing fire) or water or
sewage, necessitating entry into Limesa of outside per-
sons, who could be infiltered by target agents.

d. Ramming by vehicle, with similar results, police,
firemen, etc. .

e. Complaint to medicel authorities on filth, refuse, etc.,
leading to inspection by health authorities.

f. Various other approaches might be discussed.

6. One general recommendation can be made: sensitive material
should be used and kept in a. crypt, and a good one, rather than in
the relatively insecure special room now planned as the operational

room.

7. Beyond this, every effort should be made to see to it that
the operators have good cover. The idea of clothing them in local
clothing is excellent and shows right thinking in that direction.

Summar.

1. During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H, GNRENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed
at broadening his usefulness to the Station, These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a
recruited agent, ERFAIN-3,.% GERENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same
token, the Station hag, in effect, gained a new asset, The
LIEWPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper-
ations, The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-6, ~
were terminated on 31 May 1968. Termination was decided upon
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measure
ably decreased the reliability and effectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's
work, LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Base
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC

and LIMITED had together in the past,

GERENDE
2 During the. reporting period, tne case officer has been

meeting GHRENDH an average of three times per. week, Meetings

are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Meetings
average 20 to JO minutes, GLRENDE turns over to the case

officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
picked up from the base houses since the previous meoting,

alon,; with brief contact reports on his meetings with base

house represontatives, Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc
tions, notes for’ the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge=
ments which may be desired by the Station, Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure

of LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber, As a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber,
GERENDE's wile, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes, She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the

tapes.)

3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEAPTY agents: LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; met
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until,
termination); LIUMPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per wook -~ in his absence LIEMPTY~27 makes

- meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). Ilo is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all of the administrative problems which may develop, To judge
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents
ana is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them -- particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel,

4. AS noted in reference, GERENDE was amployed by the
Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit.
His MURAVEL activity during tne reporting period has been minimal,
but we expect it to start picking up again, SRENDE has con
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investimations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to pet
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL

delegation as possible,

5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had perlormed
nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to give GeRENDE more of the
Same, Furthermore, GERUNDE's standing assigments (LIEMPTY
base houses, MURAVER activity, and occasional sugport o: JMROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough
of GERENDE's timo, GHREND© is rather firmly committed to
WOFTRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOVTRM Sor
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any
consequence, Fy the same token, he was, throurh no fault of
his own, doiny less work lor WOFIRM than at anv time in his
career, GéRENDE'S operational exposure through the years
dictated more and more restrictions on his activity, for sound
Security reasons, The solution to GERENDE's problem (lack of
4a promising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's
worth) seened to be to give GERENDi additional tasks which he
ceuld handle ‘under suitable cover and with due regard to security
precautions, Since most of GeR“ENDEts support activities had
been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction, It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in
a non-FJSTEAL field,

6. Inline with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced
to Anarew &, DOSCHER on-17 February J9GR, The idea was that
GERENDE would be “trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations against Central American targets, GHRENDE's principal
duty, thus far has been -to take over the handling of ERFAIN-3,
undet DCSCEER's close supervision and guidance, GERENDE has
performed quite ereditably in this task. He seems interested
in the werk and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting. If GERENDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason
to believe GcRENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

7. GBRENDE was also piven the task of locating and developing

(in alias) a girl who, por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT. Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the
assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
gaining her confidence, It is quite likely that he could have
recruited the girl af an access arent against AERODENT, but as
this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least
(among other things, there was no indication that she had had

any contact with AERODENT for some months), The only flaw in
GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to
doing the job, [It should be mentioned, however, that at the

same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to
“attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed,

8. Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period wore the renting of an apartment for use as a
listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working for the MHRAVEL committee,

LICALLA

9, The star of the LIEMPTY show, as far as quality of
performance is concerned, continues to be LIEMPTY-9, His
favorable lecation and his perceptiveness continue to result in
revealing photos and cqually revealing commentary, In addition
to the 2,908 operational photos taken during the reporting
period, he has provided daily, weekly, and monthly summaries and
‘notes, Semi-nonthly attendance reports (of FJSTEAL personnel
spotted by him), various special reports, and special intensive
coverage of the following: 201-120123; 201-107668; 201-271102;
and 201-305870. As of 1 May 1968 LIEMPTY-9's salary was raised
trom 4,000 pesos to 4,500 pesos per month, LIEMPTY~9 was also
given permission to have a maid's room constructed on the roof
of his apartzent. The originai maid's room Ils LIEMPTY-!!'s photo
point, The maid, who has been with the family for 11 years
(since she vas 10) eicher sleeps in the hall, where she is in the
way, or in the bedroom of LIEMPTY-9's nine-year old son, which
LIEMPTY-~9 feels is berinning to be not a proper arrangement,

The room will be built at a point on the roof away from the
FJSTEAI installation (so as to arouse as little suspicion as
possible), and the fact that the maid will be seen going in and
out ot the reom regularly Should quiet any suspicions which may
arise. Construction work put LICALLA out of action starting

24 June, but it is expected that the work will be finished by

20 July.

should be pointed out that this blanket coverage is useful
insurance that all activity is caught. Combined wath the
daily fixed survetllance reports on all mombers of the FJSTEAL
- installation, the Station can safely say that its coverage of
FJSTEAL installation ingress and egress is complete during
working hours (and any extra hours which the Station wishes
covered). Since lk May LILYRIC has been on duty 57 hours per
week: OS00-1800 weekdays and QS00-1500 Saturdays, Commensurate
wich their new schedule (and the return of LIEMPTY-26 to the
- active roster), the total monthly LILYRIC salary has cone fron
4,900 pesos per month to 6,000 pesos per month (LIEMPTYS 13,
14, 26, and 27, are of course, father, mother, and two sons).
The fixed surveillance reports are used on a daily basis, since
the Station constantly has operational interest in knowing
whether a particular FJSTEALER was “in” or "out" at a particular
time, and if our, who he went with, what time he left, etc.
In addition, LILYRIC has standing instructions to notify
GERENDE (and GERENDE the Station) immediatoly when American
appearing visitors come to the FJSTEAL installation, Bight such
visits were noted in the reporting period, along with a number
of other visitors who, for one reason or another, attracted the

special attention of LILYRIC.

LIMITED

11, LIENPTY-6 slowed down noticoably in the reporting period,
He was ill several times, his surveillance reports were occa=
sionally inaccurate, and his photographic work was pour. With —
the assurance that LILYRIC would be able to take up the slack “-"\
(and give us better coverage for less money) the decision was
made to terminate the LIMITED base house. While we are thereby
denied some of the flexibility which we bave had in the past,
it is likely that LIEMPTY-6 would slowly have faded out ot the
picture anyway. While he was in there, he produced 911 opera-
tional photos, as well as daily fixed surveillance reports.
Following his termination (a report ot which is being rorwarded
separately) LIEMPTY-6 took a trip to Europe and has now started
working. full-time in the insurance business for his sou-in-law,
where he has gained a new lease on life. In other words, the
termination couldn't have been more amicable, LIEMPTY-8 vacated
the LIMITED apartment (he said he could not afford to: keep
paying the rent) and it is no longer available to the. Station,

REFERENCE © : RUMA-32721, 7 August 1967

1, On ZF July 1967, Raymond H. GERENDE, principal agent
for the LIEWTY project, was introduced to his new case officer,
Vincent P. 3tGZUTO, The major reason for the change in case
officers was ty briag the LIEMPTY project into the section which
it is largeir designed to support, the REDTOP section, In the
three-month geriod covered by this progress report, GERENDS was
met by the case officer 32 times, Meetings were normally pre-
arranged, ¥ith times and sites varied (with the introduction of
the new case officer, most of the former regular meeting sites
were droppe2 and new ones substituted), Meetings were occasionally
arranged vis telephone, in which.case a prearranged code was used.
Due to GERTATS's MHRAVEL activity (see below) it was not always
possible to stick to a fixed meeting schedule,

2. GERENDE met with LIEMPTYs-4, 9, and 13 on a twice-a-veek
basis, and ETEMPTY-6 once per week during this period. These
meetings were prearranged. AS explained below, GERENDE no longer

meets LIEMFSY 10.

4, LIskpTy-9, the operator of the LICALLA base house, pro-
vided 1,289 gperational photographs during this period. In
additTYon, he provided fixed surveillance reports, sighting reports,
and spectal notes and conments, LIEMPTY-9 has proven himself to
be a reliable and perceptive reporter of the events he observes,
For this reason, he has been asked to provide special coverage on
various individuals of interest, or on particular days when cover=
age 1s desired, The Station has found the LICALLA reports to be
consisteutly useful in determining the presence, activities, and
personal associations of target personnel, In part this is due
to the location of the LICALLA base house,. but it is also due to
the interest, effort, and judgement of LIEMPTY-9 hinself, ealeeted co

5. The LILYRIC basy/ house has been a prolific provider of
operational photos, 4,074 having been submitted in the period
under review. While there 15 occasionally superfluous coverage
of visiting sports and cultural delegations (and LILYRIC personnel
have been: instructed to be more selective in this respect) the
blanket coverage afforded by this base house guarantees that
nothing will be missed during normal working hours. The fixed
surveillance reports are voluminous, highly accurate, and quite
valuable, On three separate occasions during the reporting
period LILYRIC alerted the Station to the presence ot American
visitors at the target installation.

LUMITED
——-

G, The efficiency of the LIMITED base house has sutfered
a slow decline, LIEMPTY-6 has been out of action for short

~ pertods because of illness and a physical examiuation. The

physical, however, Showed that be iy in good health and we look

for an improvement in his performance in the next reporting period.
Hig survetllance reports are not entirely reliable due to a

tendency to assume that the normal occupant of a certain car is, 7
in fact, in that car, His photos, however, continue to be useful.

fa, were provided in the period under review,
mmr

7, As noted in HNMA-33279, 13 Cctober 1967, the LUENTRAP
photo vehicle, operated by LIEMPTY-10 and LIEWPTY-11, is now in
direct contact with LIEWBRACZ-1, leader of the LIEMBRACE surveil-
lance team, This arrangement, which began in mid-August 1967,
has proved to be a very happy one operationally. In addition to
permitting more flexible use of LIENTRAP for Station requirements
across the board, it has left GERENDS more tine to devote to

other duties (see below).

PHOTO LAB

. 8, LIewtyY-f has continued to process the photos taken by
the base houses, and in addition made 269 enlargements in the
period under review. During this period, the phote lab was
moved to LIEMPTY-4's office because ef renevations going on in
GERENDE's house, LIEMPTY-4 processes the photos atter working
hours, and keeps the equipment and photos locked away during the
day. As LIEMPTY-4's office is in his home, the equipmert and

photos are not left unguarded over night.

a possible access agent to LIRING. This eventually culminated
in an attempted recruitment of the prospect by GERENDS. Although
the attempt was unsuccessful, GERENDE exhibited corsiderabdle
resourcefulness and operational skill in developing the target

to a point where the recruitment attempt was possible. We plan
to use GERENDE in similar roles in the future as opportunities
‘arise, and for this reason we plan to document him with a set

of false Mexicun documentation as well as a set of false American
documentation. GERSNDE is collecting exemplars and getting the
background information needed, and once the necessary data are
assembled, Headquarters (WOACRE) support will be requested.

10. GERENDE has continued to provide support for the JMRO!
operation as needed,

11, In September and-October 1967 GERENDE was employed by
the Mexican MHRAVEL committee, He was able to get assigned as
aide to the DIZTAG delegation. In this capacity he was able to
supplement very nicely the information and support being provided
by Jeremy S. HODAPP, This foot-in-the-door came in very handy,
and is expected to be even more valuable in 1968, if GERENDPS can
get the position again, While the job was rather time-consuning
we believe that it was well worth it.

12, In connection with his duties with MHRAVEL, as well as
in connection with the fact that his WOFIRM activities are nearly
100% against the FJSTEAL target, GERENDE was given a very general
briefing on the Station's REDTOP program. jt is our hope that,
in having a better idea of what the Station is trying to do in
this field, GERENDE will be able to make an even greater contri-
bution to that program than he has in the past.

_ 4, There were no known security incidents during the pertad covered in tais
report. As a precautionary measure, the LIEMPTY vasénousekeepers. were instructed
to tiaintain incrensed vigilance in their respective areas ani tuildings and to be
prepared to evacuate any incriminating equipment and papers a moment's notice.
This was done because of the renewed interest in the assassiraticn of President
Kennedy which in turn brought forth commerits in the press about photographs .
taken of Oswald during his visit to Mexico. On three occasions during this period,
LIEMBRACE-3 survetlled tle operational meetings between GERENTS and L. =66
This was done in” order to try to ascertain if any FUSTEAL personnel were’ taking
aeasures to verify the activities of LIEMPTY-6, LIEMBRACE-3 reported that all’
of the meetings he covered appeared to de clean of hostile surveillance,

, (NOTE: Headquarters is aware of the interest FJSTEAL has taken in LIEMPTY-6,
LIEMBRACE-3 does not know the exact’ location of LIMITED/LIENTY-<¢, although he
“is aware of the existence.of this asset because of the radio alert system ‘used by.
the surveilience team whéh working the FJSTEAL-target. In omier to avoid
LIEMBRACE-3 stirvetlling LIEMPTY-6 to the exact address, LISNERACS-3 was instructed

after LIEMBRACE-3 was convinced that there vas no hostile surveillance and after

they had departed the neating area.) i

deserved vacation. The cover of the LICALLA basehouse appears to remain good,

with no undue attention devoted to it by FUSTEAL personnel,

6. This basehouse, which is staffed by LIEMPTY-13, -14 ani -27, produced

2553 frames of operational photographs during the review period. LIEMPTY-13 is
employed full-time and most of the coverage is provided by LIENPTY-14, and -27,
although during this period, LIEMPTY-14 carried the largest stare of the workload.
In March the hours in which LIEMPTY-27, a medical student, attenmiei school

were changed from the afternoon to the morning. This schedule change will remain
in effect until the end of June 1967. LIEMPTY-14 does not have the mental composure
to remain on the job for the hours needed to provide full-tise coverage and her
homekeeping duties often interfered with her working hours, In order to alleviate
this problem, the working hours of LYEMPTY-6/LIMITED were increased and those of
LILYRIC/LIEMPTY-14 decreased. No serious loss of coverage resulted from this tem
-porary change in working hours, The salary of LIEMPTY-27 was cut in half for the
period of time in which he will not be providing contimal assistance to the Project,

7. LILYRIC remains as the main source of information on WOLADY and other
foreign visitors to FUSTEAS,

CONTACT AND COMMUNTCATIONS

3. During the pericd under review, 30 meetings vere held with GERENDE by
the Project Case Officer. Meeting sites and times were varied to avoid
establishing a pattern and most meetings were scheduled at the previous meeting.
Several unscheduled meetings wore held during this period and were arranged by
the Case Officer telephoning GER:NDE to establish the meeting tice and site.
Times and sites are coded when discussed by telephone and are arranged in such
a way as to appoar to be a normal conversation. Telephone calls to GERENDE are
‘made from pay booths located away from the LNPURE installation.

vo hh, -GERENDE held twice weokly, clandestine meetings vith LIEMPTY-4, -6,
-9, ~10, -11 and -13. These regular meetings dre all prearranged and are held

at various sites and at various times of the day so that meetings correspond

with the regular habits and movements of the basehousekeepers and LIENTRAP

operators. goers]

5. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY project performed in a most
satisfactory manner during the period under review. LIFEUD-4 has deen extremely
efficient in developing and printing negatives provided by the other assets,

PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITIES

6. LICALLA. During this perfod LIEYPTY -9, operator of the LICALLA
vasehouse, provided 1,239 framec of operational photozraphs covering the patio
and garden of the FISTEAL installation, the area where meny of the officers,
family members and visitors congregate. This coverage ic especially valuable
because the officers are usually at their leisure and often gather into
functional groupings. LIEMWPTY-3 16 very observant ani his comnents and notes
are considered of great valuc to the Station. All photos provided by LIEMPTY-9

are accompanied by a fixed-survetllance report.

7. \LILYRIC. This basehouse is staffed py LLZPTY-13, -14, and -27 with
LIEMPTY-1) ahd -27 providine most of the coverage because of the full-time
outside employment of LIEMPTY-13,. During this period the LILYRIC basehouse
provided 2,716 frames of operational photographs covering the only vehicle and
pedestrian entrance into the target installation, All photograyhs were
accompanied by tixed-surveillance reports on individual members of the staff of
the target installation. The opernters are often able to grovide the license
-plate numbers of vehicles used by visitors to the target installaticn, which

in many cases help to identify the visitor.

8 LIMITED, The operator of the LIMITED basehouse is LIEMPEY-6, The
LIMITED basohouse also provides coverage of the only vehicle ani pedestrian
entrance to the FJSTEAL installation, but from a different angle, and the
ecaments made relative to coverage in the section on LILYHIC also pertain to
LIMITED. The LIMITSD basehouse provided 557 frames cf operntional photographs
during this period, LIMITED alse serves es the radio alert for the LIEMARACE
surveillance team, although the practice of using a radio alert is being de-
creased. On two oceasions during this period LIEMPTY-6 was elertins for the
tean in a deception exercise, since the team was not vorking the FUSTGAL
target. This was done on instructions from the Station and LIPOTY-6 was not
told that’ these were deception exercises.

9. LIENTRAP, During this period as in the last reporting period, the
LISVIRAP mobile surveillance wilt was targetted mainly against the local
Communist parties as well as members of other Hemisvhere parties who are
living or are in exile in Mexico. The LIENTRAP cperetcrs are LIENTTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11 and during this period they produced 564 frames of cperational
photographs. LIEMPTY-10 and LIzMPTY-l1 also service over 20 postal boxes
vrich are used es accorcdation adaresses by the Mexico City Station, Head~

quarters and other field stations,

10. Raymond H. GERENDE, Aside from his regular duties as the Frincirel
Agent fcr the LIEMPTY Project, GERENDE also provided valuable assistence in the
furtherance of objectives involved in the JMROD operation. In this regani,
Thowas G, URQUHART, Headquarters cfficer, held approximately seven cperational
meetings with GERENDE during this reporting period.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required:. For Your Information

1. In Decenter 1966 Raymond H. GERENDE, Principal Agent for the LIEMPTY
Project, was asked to prepare a security resume, including his opinions, on
the security of the LILYHIC, LIMITED and LICALLA Basehouses vis-a-vis Soviet
knowledge of their existence. Tha following paragraphs contain a slightly
edited version of GERENDE’s report, which was received on 28 Deceabur 1966,
Station comments follow GERENDE's and are so noted.

LILYRIC
2. In its present new location LILYRIC is the newest of the photo bases
under my control, According to LIEMPTY-13, there has been no indication of
interest of any sort by the Soviets in the family's move to the new apartment
nor was there in the past any show of interest or peculiar behavior on their
(Sovtet's) part with regard to the old base and the possibility that they might

be under photo surveillance.

3. The cover for the work carried on by this base is good since the
wife, LIEMPTY-14, who does most of the work has no trouble in justifying
her presence at home all of the time. The son, LIEMPIY-27 is a medical
student and attends his classes regularly and can justify his hours as
study hours, (He continues to be an excellent student and waz exeapted fron
examinations at the end of this, his second year in medical schocl, Actually,
he studies most of the night). LIFMPTY-13 requires no cover as he has @
full-time job as oroduction manager for a large concern and he usually makes
his meetings with GERENDE on his way to or from work.

DISPATCH .

4, The set-up in the old as well as the new tase is ths following:
The oquipment - caméra, 3cope and tripol -. fe mounted in one bedroom behind
venetian. blinds with one slat removed. This room is locked to keep servants
or any chance intruder from entering. The operators do not spend all their
time behind the camera, but go to the adjoining bedroom where a table and

«=. typewriter are set up and where the daily logs are transcribed, knitting done,

"or gome other activity that does not require: full concentration is carried out.
The curtains and blinds in this room are kept partially or fully open to allow
Good visibility and provide a normal appearance. Most of the daily movement of
the Soviet ‘personnel is followed from this room and when it ts necessary to

_ take pictures of visitors, unknown perscns or newly arrived Soviets, the
“operators go to the other room and use the pre-set equipment.

-5. GERENDE's Comment. It seems to me that any careful observation by
the Soviets would have revualed the tell-tale position of the venetian blinds
in both the old and the new bases. I have no doubt that the Soviets realize
they are under photo surveillance, The move by the family from the old to the
new building must surely have been noted by the Soviets. Possibly the Soviets
think the family {s working with the local authorities due to LIEMPTY-13's

former association with the Mexican Arny.

6. Station Comments, The Station agrees with GERENDS that careful
observation by the Soviets would have revealed the missing slat in the venetian
blinds and also the fact that these blimnis are seldom open. The Station also
agrees that the Soviets realize that they are under photo survefllance,.

This was pointed out recontly when a Soviet shielded an LNEKGO walk-in when
they passed the front gate of the Embassy and made a sign to the walk-in
indicating that they could be seen by someone watching with a telescope

trom the buildings across the street. Alco, as Heedquarters is aware, there
have deen numcroua comments by residents of Mexico City to the effect that
anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photographed; however, seldom has it

been rumored that the "Americans" are doing it, which might indicate most people
belteve the Mexican Government is doing any such photographing and thereby
reaffirming GERENDiE's statement that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican

Government runs the base.

7. Given the assumption that the LILYRIC base is blown, the Station at
this point does not plan to terminate or revamp the LILYRIC installation,

Any operational change by the operators would be spotted by the Soviets and
if the Base were closed the Soviets would start looking for a new installation,
Tne LILYRIC Base is performing a useful function and it is believed that it
will continue to do so. The Soviets have had opportunities to complain to

the Mexican Government about being monitored photographically and have not

seen fit to do so and it is believed that they probably wlll not do so unless
there is a radical change in soviet ani/or Mexican policy. The Station has
instructed GERENDE to take every precaution during his meetings with LIEMPTY-13
to assure that LIEMPTY-13 does not lead the Soviets to him and thereby
Jeopariizing other operations, espectally LICALLA.

LIMITED

8. The operator of the LIMITED Base, LIEMPTY-6,1s, to my knowledge,
the oldest hand in the photo surveillance of the Soviet target and possibly
the acst likely to be "burned". His residence for years at the former Base
{now the site of the new LILYRIC building) end his move to the present base
could not have gone unnoticed by the Soviets. His cover is that of an
insurance salesman, but he actually does not work at the cover and ize at
a disadvantage in trying to explain his source of income, At times, in years
past, he had to afford full-time coverage from the base, which allowed him
no tine to engage in credible cover activities.

9. GERENDE Comments. I do not believe that LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED is a
security risk; however, his present means of working from an open door leading
.to his balcony probably can be spotted by the Soviets, LIEMPLY-6 is extremely
cautious about checking himself for surveillance when making meetings.

a 10. Station Comments, The same Station comments nado in reference to
- LELYHIC aloo apply to LIFITED. Ales, the use of LIMITED na the radio alert
_taso for the LIEMBRACE curveilinnce teen has weakened the sccurity, of this
tase. In regard to LIMITED, LICOWL-1 has reported that the Soviets are very~
- {interested in LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED ord that co many Soviote have talked to him
(LICOWL-1) about LIEMPTY-6 that ho 19 convinced that the uoviets have a "rear"
and an "obsession" about LIEMPTY-6. LICCWL-1 reported on % January 1967

that the Subject of 201-744341 and the. Subject of 201-756168 asked him on
19 Deocenber 1966 for full dotnila known to him about LIFMPIY-6 and Subject of
201-756168 went so far as to say that he believes that LIEMPTY-6 is “watching

the Soviets".

LICALLA
11. When the Soviets raised the height of the wall in their backyard

about tvo years ago, they could have blocked completely the view of this
base's working window by making the wall a few inches higher. Since they did
not do this, it would seem to indicate that they are not awere that their
activities are being monitored from. this point. On the other hand, in recent
months LIEMPTY-9, the. operator, has reported that activitios in the back
vard have been curtailed more and mores For example, the women no longer
. congregate there datly, the school children enter their classes by a route

not visible to LIEMPIY-9 ar. the trees and shrubs have not been trimmed in

s view poor in coct directions. LI:MPTY-9 says that

years, making LIEMPTY-9'
he has never noticed any undue interest in his house or his activities by
the Soviets. Access to the operating room can be soon from the window which) ' i aa

LIEMPTY-9 believes to be the commo room in the target installation.

. 12, The cover for this base is that of a normal residence. LIEMPTY-9's
cover work io that of a car and insurasice salesman ina local automobile

agency in the afternoon only. LIEMPTY-9 does work in his cover. LIEMPTY-9's

cover for the use of the operating roon 4s that he does accounting work for

 elient firms. ‘The door is kept locked at all times and LIEMPTY-9 never aliows
the servant to enter, even for cleaning purposes. The oquipment is kept
locked in a trunk within the room when not in use and all logs and photos

are kept in a safe located in LIEMTY-9's bedroom closet.

13. -GERENDE Comment. I believe the Soviets are aware of the photo
surveillance being carried out by this base due to the position of the window
and the curtains during the hours when LID“PTY-9 is operating.

The Station does not believe that this photo base
This belief {6 based on the fact that the LICALLA
coverage is excellent and there. has been no indication that the Soviets act
for tho benefit of observers while they are in the backyard. It is interesting
to note that the Soviets made no effort to "protect" the LNERCO walk-in mentioned
in paragraph 6. above during a vieit to the backyard and LICALLA did obtain
photographs of the walk-in, The school children no longer pass through the
backyard because the location of the school was recently chanzed and the children
now go by another route. The Station has instructed GERENDE to take every pre-

caution in order to protect the security of the LICALLA base.

14, Station Comment.
is known to the Soviets.

15. As a generdl coment pertaining to the security of the bases in-
volved in Project LIEMPTY, it should be noted that tho Soviets are aware of
the fact that LIMOUSINE is the owner/builder of the now LILYRIC building.
LIMOUSINE is also the owner of the LIMESA complex, through a holding company.

16. The Station realizes that most of the details reported in this

dispatch are Jmown to Headquarters; however, the Station. wanted to make the
opinions of the Principal Agent and the Station a mattor of record ina

consolidated form.

2. AGENT. COMMUNTCATIONS CONTACT. AND_PERFORMANCE

During the period under review, Raymond H. GERENDS was seen 2. times in
rosular operational meetings by the LIEMTY Project case officer. Mo basic
changes other than the regular preplanned variations in meeting sites and
“times vere made in the Project commnication channels, The up-datei and
revised emergency communication system for contact with GERENDS (see
HMMA-28333, dated 21 February 1966) reasins in effect. All regular contact
with the active LIEMPTY agents (LIE@TYs -4, -6, -9, -10, -11, -13, -24,
and -26) was maintained via Raymond H. GOBRENDS. GERENDE met each of the
“" “above cited agents, with the exception of LIEMPTYs -14, and -26, two times
>- each week in clandestine meetings, The operational performance of all active
__LIEMPTY agents, including GERENDS was most satisfactory. The performance
a: LIEMPTY=4 in ‘assisting the local WACRE section vith its photosraphic

processing was outstanding,

|__-_3,.. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROORESS AND ACRTEVENENTS

A. SUMMARY - Throughout the reporting period, the LIEMPTY Project contimed
to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and surveillance
reports used by the Station in its planning and operations against the
LIMERICK installation and personnel. The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to be
& particularly reliable tool for: following the daily comings and goings
of the LIMERICK personnel; providing leads to and confirming the identi-
fications: of new LIMERICK staffers and also visitors to the LINERICK installa-
tion; providing leads to tha relative rank and the specific intelligence
service affiliation of various LIMSRICK officers; keeping the Station abreast
of construction and physical changes in the LIMERICK physical plant; and

“~"" providing a reliable check on various Station and LNERGO access agents.
During the quarter under review, Project LIEMPTY basehouses provided 5,003
frames of operational photographs (109 rolls) as well as 1,290 pages of
fixed surveillance reports covering the movements of the LINSRICX staffers.

B. LIENTRAP - Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mobile unit was again
targetted heavily against leaders and meeting sites of the locel Ccamunist
parties ag well as other targets of opportunity, particularly Haitian,
Guatemalan and Honduran Communist exile leaders now resident in Mexico.
LIENTRAP provided up-dated and/or new identification photographs which

are of value to both the JMPIGER and the Station recruitment /penetration
‘program. This apparat provided a total of 237 operational photographs,
while the personnel attached to this LIENTRAP unit regularly serviced 23
postal accommodation addresses used by Nexico City Station, Headquarters and

other field Stations.

C. LIMITED - During this quarter, the LIM(TED basehouse provided 724 frames
of operational film as well as datly physical surveillance reports covering
the arrival and departure of all LINERICX personnel and visitors at the

front gate of that installation during the evening and week-end hours. In
addition,. LIEMPTY- 6, the LIMITED basshousekeeper, working from his excellent
‘visual vantage point, dispatched the LIEMBRACE surveillance team via radio on

several LIEMSRACE surveillance operations.

D. LILYRIC - During this reporting period, the LILYAIC basehouse provided
2,859 frames of operational photographa covering the same area and targets
noted in the LIMITED section above, out during the morning and afternoon
hours. In October the LILYRIC personnel (LIEMPTYs -13, ~14, -26 and -27)
successfully completed the move into the new LIMOUSINE building. While some
photographic coverage was lost during the move, LILYRIC coverage at present
is back to norwal (see also paragraph 4 of Reference A.).

£, LICALLA ~- Throughout this period, the LICALLA basehouse provided both
physical observation and photographic coverege of the garnien and patio of the
LIMERICK installation, an area where uany of the officers, their families and
visitors congregate. In providing this coverage LICALLA produced 1 Pelsy)
individual photographs (of which 60 were color prints used in the Station's
“aug book") ag well as regular daily reports on the sulient activities in this

area.

AGENT COMMUNICATION, CCNIACT AND P2TUFCRMANCS.
During the period under review, GEREND? was seen 25 tines in regular
operational meetings by the LIEMPTY Project case officer. No basic
departures, other ‘than the remular pre-planned changes in meeting sites:
and time, were made in the regular and alternate comminication channels.
The up-dated and revised emergency communication system for contact
with GERENDE as forwarded to Headquarters in HMMA-28333, dated 21
February 1966 remains in effect. During the period under review, the
emergency contact arrangements pertinent to LIEMPTYs -4, -6, -9, -13
and -14 were reviewed by GERENDS and the respective agents. The
operational performance of all active LIDMWTY agents waa highly satis-
factory, As per usual, GERENDE turned in the solid operational performance
which the Station has come to expect from this long-time contract agent.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS.
A. Summary - Throughout the reporting period, the LIEMPTY Project
continued to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs
and physical surveillance reports used by the Station in its operational
planning against the LIMERICK installation and personnel. The LIEMPTY
coverage has proved to bs a particularly reliable tool for: following
the daily movements of LIMERICK personnel; providing leads to and con-
firming the identities of LIMERICK staffers and their visitors; pro-
viding leads to the relative rank and the specific intellizence service
connection of various LIMERICK officers; keeping the Station abreast of
construction changes in the LIMFRICK physical plant; and providing a
reliable check on various “tation and LNZRGO access azents. During the

targetted against leaders and meeting sites of the local Communist
parties as well as other targets of opportunity, particularly exile
Communist leaders now resident in Mexico, LIEMTRAP provided up-dated
identification photographs of Communist officers which are of value to
poth the JMPIGER prosram and the Station's recruitment /penetration
programa. This apparat provided 282 operational photographs, while the
personnel attached to the LIENTRAP unit alco regularly serviced 21 postal
accomnodation addresses used by Mexico City Station, Headquarters and
other Field Stations. In July, the LIENIRAP unit was repainted and

completely overnauled.

C, LIMITED - During this quarter, the LIMITED pbasenouse provided 1,215
frames (47 reels) of operational film as well as daily physical surveil-
lance reports oovering the arrival aud departure of all LIMERICK personnel,
at the front gate of that installation during the evening and weekend
hours. In addition, LIEMPYY-€, the LIMITED basehouse keeper, served

as the radio dispatcher for numerous LISMBRACE surveillance operations.

D, LILYRIC - During this periou, the LILYRIC basehouse provided a record
3,301 frames (99 reels) of operational photographs covering the same
area and targets as noted in the LIMITED section above, put during the
morning and afternoon hours, As noted in paragraph 5 of reference Aes
Station completed the rearrangement of the LIMETED-LILYRIC working hours,
based on the recent recruitment and clearance of LIEMPTYs -26 and -27.
‘he LILYRIC tasehouse now provides photographic and physical surveillance
coverage from 0€00 hours through L/du nours, wilie LEMITED proviess
coverage from 1700 hours to 1920 hours on weekdays. LIMITED also

SECURITY_AND: PLANS.

‘A, There had been no known incidents during the reporting perieda vhich
aversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY or the personnel

Baven

attached thereto.

B. In omter to alleviate a portion of the pressure caused by the recent
major adjustment in the Station's WOACRE section, the LIEMPTY phote-
graphic base during the ensuing period, will process various Station
photographic requirements which normally do not fall within the realm

of this Project.

C. It is anticipated that the LILYRIC personnel (LIEMPIYs -15, “14, -26
ami -27) will move into the new LIMOUSINE building during the forthcoming
pericd. Little, if any, coverage will be lost during this cove. Other
than noted above, no significant operational or administrative changes

are planned for the eneuing period.

During the reportinz perial, GERENDE was seen 34 times ir. recular
operational meetings by the undersi-med and on 5 occastons Dr the Headquarters’
AMROD operations officer, Thomas G, URQUEART. All meetinss were recularly
rotated anons echt selected sites. No basic departures were mle iron

for meetings wider emergency coniitions, are bein; worked act wit: GERENDE.

3. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS» ACHIRVESENTS

. a) SUMEARY - Throughout the reporting period, Project LISETY
continued td provide the vast aatority of the operational photestaphs and
phyatcal surveillance reports usei in Mexico City Station's operations
targetted against the LIMERICK installation and personnel. Tuis activity
is in direct support of, and in consonance with, the current NO as approved
for the Station, - The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to be a mst reliable

| tool 'fort following the daily movements of LIMGRICK personnel; oreviding
leads to, and confirming the identities of LIMERICK starfers ani their
visitors; verifying the relative rank and specific intellisence service
connection of various LIMERICK officers keeping the Station abreast of
construction changes ef the LIAICK physical plant; and verityins reports
of Station access agents, During the period under review, the LISPTY
basehouses produced 4,212 photosrapis (149 rolls) as well as 20 pases of
fixed surveillance reports covering this target.

bd) LTENTRAP - Throughout this period, the LIENIRAP medileuntt vas
targetted asainst leaders and meeting-sites of the local comunist parties
as well os other targets of opportunity. Specifically, LIENTRAP provided
up-to-date photosraphs of numerous communist officials, which sre of value
to both the JMPIGER program and the Station's penetration/recriitzent
presram, The LIENTRAP unit and personnel also remierly serviced 21 postal
accommodation addresses used by Mexico Cily Station, Headquarters, ani other
field Stations, The LIENTRAP unit provided a total of 40k operational

photogrephs.

ec) LIMITED - During the reperting period, the LIMITED dbasehouse
provided 1,412 frames (54 rolls) of cgecrational film and daily otservation
reports covering the arrival and departure of LIMERICK persarnel snd
visitors at the trent gate of the installation during the aSternoon and early
evening hours, In addition, LISNPTY-G, the LIMITED basehouse keeper, served
as the radio dispatcher on several LIENBRACE surveillance operations. The
value and need of the LIMITED fixet-radio dispatching base has Deen explained
in detail in previous LIEMPTY Frocress Reports.

d) LILYRIC - During this period, the LILYRIC basehouse protuced 1,542
frames (54 rolls) of operational photographs, covering the saze erea and
targeta noted in the LIMITED section, but during the morning ans early.
afternoon hours. In addition, LILYRIC prepared a weekly report an the
comings and goinss of each LINERICS staffer and contributed the sajority of
this project's physical surveillance reports.

e) LICALLA ~ Throughout this period, the LICALLA basehouss provided
photographic coverage of the sarvien and patio area of the LIVERICX in-
stallation, an area where many of the officers, their families, avi visitors
congregate. In covering this area, LICALLA produced 1,253 intivitcal
photographs as well as regular reports on the activities of various officials
of special interest to the Station,

f) LIENPTY-4 - ALL the above noted operational film (155 rolls, 4,616
frames) provide? by the basehouses ani the LIENTRAP unit wes ¢e eloped and
printed by LYIery-4 at the LIEATTY vhoto processing dase. 25 atei in

gs) Rasmond H, GERSNDE - Tirtne the reporting period, GERENDE served

as the full-time LIETiy F/A, operating as the cutout te the LIMITED,
LILYRIC, and LICALLA basehouses and bearing the asent handling responsibility
for the operators of the LIEMCRAP mobile unit as well as. LIEMPTY-4 and
LIEPTY-19, a Station asset (translator) carried under Project LIFEAT. This
overall assienment involvel at least twelve clandestine agent meetings per
-week (in addition the 34 meetinss held with the Troject Case Officer).

. ° GERENDE also made numerous ani essential contributions to the sensitive

> AMRCD operation, It should be noted that GERENDS's alertness in spotting

the PORUMEN surveillance of one of the AMROD accommodation addresses,
undoubtedly saved this sensitive deception operation from exposure by ‘the

opposition.
&,  SECURTTY AND PROBLEMS

’ Other than the attempted PBRUMEN surveillance of the AMROD accommodation
address noted above (which was neutralized by GERENDS's alertness), there
have been no known incidents which adversely affected the security of the
LIEMPTY project or the related agent pernonnel. ‘hile several minor ad-
ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.

5. CHANGES AND PLANNING

a) One major operational change is planned for the ensuing period.
Upon completion of the new LIMOUSINE structure (see HMMA-25352, dated 10
February 1965), the Station will move the present LIGYRIC basehouse
personnel (LIEMPTYs 13, Lt, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the
LIMITED (LIEMPTYs 6 and 7) personnel as originally planned, Ancillary
modifications are: 1) To increase the hours of both the photographie and
physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILYRIC operators (dawn to
dusk) during the week days and 2) have LIMITED provide photosraphic and
physical surveillance coverege on weex-ends only, while remining on daily
stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments, ‘Ties? changes were dictated by
the following considerations:

1) The new LIMOUSINE building will offer a much detter vantage point
for both photosraphic and physical surveillance than does the present
complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases, Therefore, the
Station feels that the personnel occupying this new base should be
those possessing the highest technical skills and also those able to
provide the most thorough ani complete coverass., Since the LIMITED base
now has only one trainet operator while the LILYRIC basehouse has three,

the LILYRIC group is indicated,

2) Because it appears that the coverage of the LIMERICK installation
will be a long- ze and continuing requirement, the Station desires
to staff the new hase with personnel of long-ranse potential. Since
LIEMPTY-G is now almest 60 years old, it is obvious that he does not
possess this potential; however, the TILYRIC asent complex happily
combines experienced personnel with youthful agents.

3) Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC peraonnel is
much more compatible and consistent with the environment of the new
building than is that of the LIMITED family. .

While it ia anticipated that these modifications and changes will initially
cause varicus administrative and operational probleas, it is believed that
all such adjustments can te handled locally.

b) ‘The requisite copies of the PRQ Part II pertinent to LIE@TY-26
were forwardod to eadquarters with MMA-Q7603, aatet 9 November 1065 alone
with a requést for a full Operational Approval for Sudject for use as & eut-out
to the LILYRIC basehouse. LIE“PTY-27 was granted a Provisional Operational

Approval. on 26 January 1966 for use as a part-time tasehouse keeper/operator
at the LILYRIC installation, .

MEMORANDUM FOR: = Director of Logietica |

ATTENTION: Mr. Edward Deaisoa
SUBJECT: LIEMPTY, LIMCUSINE
REFERENCE: Mexi 2159

1. In convereation with the Headquarters officer concerned
with LIEMPTY LIMOUSINE affairs, thia Cifice was apprised of the
fact that the proposed transaction, outlined ia refs eenee cable, would
be executed without rccourge to advice on the legal aapects of the
sale under Mexican law and with no intennaa to make LIMOUSINE's
commitment to this Agency logally bindiag. itle furthers intended _
that LIMOUSINE's "promissory notes" be wasecured, :

2. Should the proposed transactian be carricd out in this
manner, this Agency would be unable to caforce LIMOUSINE's
promise to pay his debt, and would have za legally cogaivable inotrue
ment ta present to an executor of his estate should he dic before
meeting hia obligationa to us. In addition, eur right to continued
poseesaion of the apartment would be tenums at beat,

3, Thus it is planned to convey raal estaie apyraised at
$14,448 in exchange for $7,200 and a caliectiua of unenforceable,
unsecured promises. itis hard to believe that in this case, opcras
tonal security precludes closer protection of Ageacy assets.

1,’ “It would appear from paragraphs 2a and 2b of refereace that

KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops have not been completely inforimeéd-of the back-
ground of the LIEMPTY Project and its agent-requirements, At the time
HMMA-14093 (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it
was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additfonal
questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the
senior staffs, which might be raised during the renewal process,

2, In answer to paragraph 2a, Oliver G, SCANTLING first contacted
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early. 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement,
He visiced her as an architect tterested in viewing the LIMERICK -instalation
from the building where she lives, He was socially acquainted with her brother,
a Catholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist,
However, it would be imprudent on the Station's and SCANTLING'S part to
assume that PARADA does not at least suspect that some anti- LIMERICK
intelligence service is involved, PARADA suggested during SCANTLING's
initial visic that he couid return at sny time for further observations, This
was reported by SCANTLING on 21 March 1957 and it does not seem appropriate
to query him again on the pretext for his recent visits,

3. While HMMA-14093 correctly referred to LIMITED, LULYRIC and

* LICALLA as "phorographic basehouses, " the Station would like te emphasize
that photographic coverage is oily one of their functions (please see HMMA-12095,
4 February 1959), LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for atomobile
surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of persons entering

the front gate, Their photography is aegligible compared to their other duties,
The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the victures is from the
second {loor and above the street tratfic which partially blocks LIMITED
photographs, LILYRIC also does individual reports on LIMERICK personnel
entering and leaving the main gate, . LICALLA is used almost exclusively to
identify LIMERICK officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in
connection with the LIMESA/LLIMUST Project. As an indication of the effect-
iveness of LICALLA photographic coverage, the Mexico Station has all rhe
LIMERICK officials identified, Before this base was activated more than two-
thirds of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified. In order to support other
operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all LIMERICK
officials, In this respect, LICALLA aas provided most of the necessary infor-
mation, The retention of this base is also considered vital to.the security of
the LIMUST portion of the LIMESA Project,

4, The Station does not agree that the color photography and moving
pictures are a luxury, Color slides were made for identification purposes
and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial features and skin
coloring. The motion pictures were made at Headquarters suggestion (Please
see HMMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HMAMIW-8438, 26 January 1960).

1, On 13 October 1959 it was learned from source that the local ODENVY
chief got a priority cable from his Headquarters asking why data concerning the
Mexican apprehension of the (KUBARK) truck and photographer had not been re>
ported to the U. S, Ambassador locally. The statement was made that "such
matters as this should be immediately reported to the Ambassador,"

2. This cable resulted from the report the ODENVY office sent in on
the incident from the knowledge they had - as reported in reference,
i

3, The local ODENVY chief replied to his Headquarters that he did not
agree that matters coneerning KUBARK operations should be reported by ODENVY

to the Ambassador,

4. Source stated that the cable was obviously a result of the KUBARK/

ODENVY headquarters "ill feeling" which presently exists and which source
believes ig primarily (and principally) attributable to the article in TRUE magasin

of Septen:ber 1959,
5, Source is LIMEW.

contained herein be disseminated in any form: whatsoever outside KUBARK,.

GERENDE (ps), the Principal Agent who handles LIEMPTY-t0, that L-10 was being
held by the Secret Service. Immediately followin this notification, Alen W. WARE

4, Since GERENDZ ‘vas known to L-10 and since the Station could not be

given the following instructions:

A. To disconnect immediately the LIFEAT/LIVERY lines in the base
where he and hia -vife ‘vere living and to move all equipment to another safe
location, It was believed appropriate to take this precaution even though L-10
did not know the location of the LIVERY base, the telephone number of the
base, or even that GERZENDE was living at a place other than his mother's
residence in another part of the city,

5, During the evening of 20 September the Station LIFEAT Case Officer
was advises that ‘GERENDE had been airceted to disconnect the LIVERY lines
and lo transter all BIFEAT equipment to a safe location, Te further insure the
security of LIVERY, all LIVERY lines were palled externally during the early
morning af ll September,

&, At approximately 1000 hra., 21 September, LIMEW informed the Chief
of Station that a contact of his (LIMEW's) had just informed him that L-10 (true
name) and the LIGNTRAP vehicle were being held by the Sceret Service, LIMEW
stated that if L-10 was one of KUBARK's agents he would attempt to have his
contact in the Secret Service obtain lis inumediate release, LIMEW was told
that L-10 was, in fact, a KUBARK ayent and that the Station would very much
Appreciate his cfforts to effect his release, A short while later LIMEW again
contacted the Chief of Station and informed him that it would be necessary for
documented ODACID official personally to contact a Commandante fnu LIMO!
of the Seeret Service and that L-10 would then be released. According to LIMEW,
L-10 had told the Seerct Service that he was carrying out his operational photo-
graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; therefore, an ODACID |
official would have to establish L-10's bona fides.

2. As the Station learned later, the Secret Service agents were roughing up
some of the individuals attending the rally; consequently, they were endeavering
to make sure that no photographs were taken which could be used apainet then by
ists, L-l0 and L-lt, the LEENTRAP driver who loft the scene before }
di, were just preparing to leave the arca after taxing five rolls of film
when a Secret Service agent demanded a search of the vehicle on the suspicion that
it conta:ned Communist propaganda, L-10, his camera w:th telephoto lens and
the film were then discovered in the rear of LIENTRAP, It was at this time that
L-10 was accused orally by the police officers of being a Soviet agent and later of
being a leeal Communist agent, After being taken to Secret Service Headquarters,
L-10 tala LIMON, in private, about his association with ODACID and cmphasized
that he certainly was not a Communist agent, LIMEW's source (possibly Com-
mandante ULMON), believing that there may be some truth in L-10's statement,
contacted LIMEW, Based in part on assumption and in part on fact, this is the
Station's opinion as to how ODENVY became involved in the case,

3. The Station, realizing that LIEMPTY-10 had not committed an illeyal

rimself ag an ODACLD official and told them that L-10 did from time
to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the

field of local Communist activities, WARE also told LIMON and MiENDICLEA
that L-10 was never permitted to do any task which was illegal under Mexican
law and that if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,
but on hig own volition, They implied that L-10 had not done anything illegal and
that all they wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agent, L-
10 was immediately released and the LIENTRAP vehicle returned to him with ail
ntact, including the five rolls of undeveloped film.

L-10's statement that he did sume photopraphic work for ODACID,

10, During his visit to Sceret Service Headquarters WARE discovered that
L-10 had not been booked or formally charyed with an allecai act and that neither \
LIMON nor MENDIOLZA could recall L-10's name. L-10 was not placed in jail '
during the 26 hours he waa at Secret Service Headquarters but, rather, was permuitt
to remain in the Secret Service azents' duty roum, No bribes were necessary to
obtain hia release; however, por LIMEW's request, $500.00 pesos were given to
LIMEW to yive to his source, LIMEW said that in addition to notifying him about
L-10's detention, the source was also responsible for all equipment and film being

returned intact to L-10,

1i, TESSAROLO was advised, as soon ay LIMZW became involved in the cas

that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further, ‘Two bottles of
scotch whiskey were given to the lawyer through Ti SSAROLO for the few taske he

had alrcady performed,

12, After his release, L-10 reported that he was not interroyated and that he
did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give 'the
names of anybody connected with operational activitics. Based on the developments
in the case, the Station has no reason to doubt the veracity of L-10's statement.: L-
10 was reprimanded for his use of statements to the Seerct Service about being |
employed by ODACID, He was told that the revelation of such employment was ta
be made only by the Station and that henceforth he is never to uge such a cover
story, L-10 was also reprimanded for hiu lack of judgment in reniaining in an areca
where there was a stron; concentration of police; it ia believed safe to asnume that
L-10 will never mace this same mistake ayain,

13. In retrospect, it is interestiny to note that L-10's use of the ODACID
employrnent story 1s possibly responsible for his not being interrogated and thua
compromising othet operationa and individuals, This case has pointed out to the
Station the desireability of having casual contacts in the Secret Service and other
local pelice-type organizations oo that the Station, rather than ODACID anil ODENYV

handled by the Station, it must be assumed that the police will occasionally appre-

for pretext investigations'and routine static surve illances; however, a principal agent,
Simon D, CLACKETT, is currently being trained in tlead quarters to assume the

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS -- OLIVER G,_SCANTLING SEGMENT

2, Agert Information ~ Oliver G, SCANTLING has continued to perform his
+ assigned tasks in an outstanding manner, SCANTLING's poise, common sense,
education, ideology and native ability for the pursy it of clandestine activities
make him one of the most valuable suppor tassets available to the Mexico City -
Station, The fact that SCANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief
Enginee r and Production Manager for a local manufacturing compan y adds to
his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent, Ontwo occasions dur ing the past
stx months SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to
resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK ope rational
duties; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this on che
basis that he has more long-range potential when his cover occupation is Legitimate,
Of course, SCANTLING would be more valuable if he could work full time forthe
Station, bur not sufficiently so to warrant his resignation from his overt job (his
monthly salar, in his overt job is in excess of $800.00 U, S.), The only
significant limitation that SCANTLING has evidenc cd to his present Ca se Officer
is his occasional delay in prepar ing written reports of investigations and other
‘Tmatters requiring reports for the files, However, this timitation gradually is
being overconie and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to
be factual, comprehensive and soan will be promptly submitted, os gray

3, Security Developments - SCANTLING is constantly under a conside: able
amount Of exposure and pressure when fo Nowing up LIMESA leads obtained from
LIFEAT and the photographic bases, Since time is always of the essence when
using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make approaches
to individuals performing services for the LIME RICK target after routine, and
sometimes only cursory, investigation, Therefore, the possibility always oxists
of his entanglement in an undesirable secu rity incident, This neces sarily

accurate drawing of the type door installed at LIMERICK, This drawing was
forwardal to Headquarters via HMMA -11926, 21 January 1959,

E, Casing Report on West German Embassy - During June, July and
August 1958, SCANTLING prepared a detailed casing report on the new
West Ger man Embassy, SCANTLING's engineering ability enables him to
prepare accurate drawings and sketches from a minimum of data, Also,
his personality and gregarious manner permit him to visit the inside of such
establishments, with an appropriate cover story, and retain minute details
which later he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehen sive floor
plan and important construction data,

F, “LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's long asso ciation with th is
target from the casing standpoint provides the Stat ion with an unparalleled
sou rce of in formatien about LIMERICK construc tion activ ities, modifications
and reasons for same, AU of the LIMERICK cas ing reports on file in Head =
qua rters are the product of SCANTLING’s unusua] a bil ity and knowledge,
Consultations with Station Officers about LIME RICK construction have been
of benefit to the Stat iondiring this reporting period an. they wili continue to
be of worthwhile importance,

G, Routine Investigations and Surve illances - Although the Station has
sev eral assets capable of performing investigations and surv cil lances,
SCANTLING is still used in situations requiring the utmost in discretion and
clandestinity, His activities in this connection are too numerous co list
here; suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Station's
collection of operational in formation through his investigative efforts,
SCANTLING's interview of Paul Frederick Kir schho ff (201-4 3645) of LCMAY-
FOWL interest is an example of SCANTLING's use on-investigations (see
HM MA-11749, 17 December 1958),

H, ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM-15 during
the latter's December 1958 trip to Mexico City, In this connection
SCANTLING is 4 suppori asset which is trustworthy and dependable,
SCANTLING never displays undue curiosity in operations such as the ESGEM=-15
one; he accepts the minimum amount of informaticn given and performs his
duties in a professional and sincere manner,

I, LIEMPTY/3 - SCANTLING handles the administ rative mart ers conn ected
with L/3, Doris M, XILLGO provides oper ational direction to L/3, During
this reporting period, -he Scat ion had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the
ope rational super visioa of L/3's.activities, However, af ter a four-month
trial period with both SCANTLING and KILLCO niceting with L/3, it was
decided that it would be desirable for KIILGO to continue handling L/3. L/3's
unusual personality 2nd intellect indicated that he could best be directed by
a PBPRIME citizen, Therefore, SCANTLING no longer attends KI_LLGO's
and L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's
administrative problems,

“Mexico City: in Dece mber 1958 and January 1959, it was considered app ropriate
for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP, Although this
procedure defeats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner
in which the Station could maintain efficiency with the three operations listed

above . SCANTLING has known.the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA
and LIENTRAP for several years, In fact, he was at one time the agent in

’ cha rge of these three operations,

5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Period - The VIDALES operation
(see parag rapn 4 (C) above) indicated to te Stat ion the necess ity for thorough
brief ings and discussions with the agent making an approach to a target, This can
hardly be described as a new operational method, but it does serve to ilustrate
the minimum efforts that should be followed, The forthcoming LINIMENT IV
Loperation whe rein SCANTLING must recruit the Jandlord of the ia reet's building
is of fering SCANTLING and the Station the opportunity to prepare thorou ghly for
SCANTLING's recruitment pitch, The excellent documentation prepared by
KURIOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Station should increase
the batt ing average on SCANTLING's cold approaches, (See HMMA ~11365, 22
October 1958, and HMMW~7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on
this Subject),

In a general sense, one other conclusion can be made about any Station's
support apparatus - where technical and photographic operations are poss ibie,
the utility of the information obtained is enhanc cd consider ably by accurate,
comprehen sive and timely casing reporis, SCANTLING, as previously mentioned,
is an excellent asset for this t ype of support,

6, Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959,
As of that date SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3, 600, 00 U. S,
for two years, The Station plans to raise his annual compensation to $4,000.09
U.S, No other significant administrative problems exist,

7, Outlook for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued
utilization of SCANTLING in the Same manner as he is presently being used,
The Station will keep SCANTLING as an independent asset and, it is hoped, resist
the temptation to make him a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents, It
is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be wo rtiwh ile
to the Station for many years to come and that every effor: should be made to protect
his security and value to KUBA RK,

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND H, GERENDE SEGMENT

8, Agent Intormation - Aside from the agent information given in HMMA- 11368
22 October 1953, the only significant development was GERENDE's Dec ember 1958
marriage to a U, S,. educated girl of Dutch citizenship. The$ 500,00 U. S, for the
purchase of two plane tickers as a wedd ing gift to GERENDE was designed to
impr ess GERENDE with the fact that KUBARK thinks highly of him as an individual
and that KUBARK has a great interest in his intelligence career, GERENDE is at
the age and stage in life whe re he is beyinning to wonder just what the future holds
for him, In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE

and request a new contract that provides for some type of retirement benefit s.~
perhaps similar to the Civil Service Retirement progecam for KUBARK employees,

9.. Security Developments - Again, the information on this suhject was covered
adequately in AMMASTIRS- GERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING
and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles duties on 10 Dece mber 1958, This, of course, was
jin line with recommendations contained in HMMA~11368 and represents a definite
security improvement, GERENDE wis toid that LIFEAT/BGMORNING was being
texminated because it had not been productive of cnough significant information and
that LIFEAT/Cuban Exiles was being terminated because the occupants of the target
apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cubans are concerned,)

dditional secur ity -improvements will be made when Simon D, CLACKETT returns
to Mexico and relieves GERENDE of respons ibility for the LYERSEY sur veilla nce

tcam,

10, Operational Success and Effectiveness ~ Bricfly reviewed below are the -
lseparateé oper ational activities which GERENDE managed during the period covered

‘ jby this report:

A, LIMITED - This base functioned smoothly, securely and efficiently
dur ing the period July through December 1958, ‘The base operator, LIEMPT Y/
demonstrated his usual competence and devotion to duty, in addition to the
primary objective of taking photographs of individuals of interest, L/6 also
preparcd detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of all target
personnel, weckly reports of workers activities at the LIME RICK instal lat ion,
per formed three one-man surve illanc es of Mexicans working at LIMERICK in
an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING
with information on LIMERICK construction, During this six-month period,
LIEMPTY/6 took approx imately 800 photographs from the LIMITED base,

B. LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIFMPTYs/13 and 14, with LIEMPTL ¥/
12 serving as a cutout between the base and GERENDE, LIE MPTY/14 does most
of the photogra phy and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular
job and is not on the premises during -regular daytime working hours, L/14
dev otes approximately six hours (0800-1 400) each day to photography and the
remaining time is spent preparing reports, The Base personnel cormpile
individual lo gs on each target personality indicating their arrivals and depa rtures
from the LIME RICK installation (Note: These reports are filed in the
app ropriate Station 201 file and are available to Stat ion officers in analyzing a
target personality 's pattern of daily activity), LILYRIC also prepared a
weekly report on workers activities at the Club and reports the license plate
numbe rs of all vehicles dischar ging or picking up individuals at LIMERICK,
(Note: These license plate numbers are then checked our through LIV ES TOCK/2
for the owne rs names and addresses - in case of immediate or later operational
interest,) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, OUSLER met
directly with LIEMPYY/ 12, During this period appr oximatel y2,000 photographs
were taken from the LILYRIC base, _

C. LICALLA - While LILYRI C and LIMITED are excellent bases for
pio tographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK instal lat ion,
the LICALLA base is the Station's best source of photographs of LIMERICK

employees, LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of target
personne! in the garden area of LIME RICK, LIE MPTY/9 is the base operator
for LICALLA and in the Station's opinion performs his job in an outstanding
manner, As reported in IMMA -11368, LIEMPIY/9 is the brother of former
LIPST ICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member arrested in
June 1958), No repe rcussions, or indications of any impending ones, have

> resulted in this family relationship, This, certainly, is the major security
problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period, L/9 and his family soon
will have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period cf time required to remodel
it, The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer

wns the LICALLA ‘base and the threc adjoining houses and every effort is

being made to preserve this secret from L/9, (See HMMA~12032, 28 January
1959, for a more detailed explanation.) Of course, during the remodeling of
LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA reporting or photographs, In addition
to caking approximately 2,500 photographs during this six-month period, the
LICALLA base also prepared weckly reports on LIMERICK garden activ ities,
These reports indicate which LIMERICK employees are seen together each day,
which vehicles different employees are accustonied to using, construction activitfes

and other matters which appear of significance w L/9,

D, LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhtic Station asset,
Approximately 1,400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous
targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubradly
remain one of the Station's best investigative asses, As explained in the Field
Pro ject Outline, forwarded to Headquarters on 8 Getober 1958, the Sration is
of the opinion that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible,
4,3 © Nearly four months have elapsed without receiving Headquarters authority to

nA repiace the vehicle, The security situation is even more acute now than at the
time of the request, LIEMPTYs 10 and 11 do an excellent job on LIENTRAP

ope rations,

E, LIJERSEY - This operation can be characterized as somewhar dormant
for the July - December 1958 period, Because of GERENDE's other important
activities, he did not have the time to train and work w ith the surveilance team,
Also, the Station consider ed that it would be stretching security just a bit too fa.
to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling
the photogra phic base houses ard performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/
BGMORNING and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles, The expected arrival of Simon D,
CLACKETT in April and his relieving GERENDE of LITERSEY will enable

the Station totrain, withina year, an efficient mebile surveillance team,

At present, LIEMPT Ys/15, 16 and 17 compose the LEERSEY team,

F, LIF EAT ~ Until 10 December 1958 GERENDE served as monttor
in the basc house containing LIF EAT/ BG MORNING and LUFEAT/Cuban
Exiles, In addition to living in the base house, GERENDE also transcr ibed
the majority of the SGMORNING and Cuban Exile ta pes, He performed

these jobs satisfactofily even though his efficiency was handicapped by numerous
‘other duties, Relieving GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties enables him to devote
more time to his other operations with a corresponding inecease in che securin

of all his activities,

SBIJECT s Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico

c

REFERENCE s WH/FI Memorandum of 14 October 1958

1, The subject of the recruitment of a physical surveillance team in
the United States for use in Mexico as well as other areas within Wil has
long been a topic of discussion at Headquarters, While it is palpably ri-
diculous to consider the use of a surveillance team recruited and trained
4n the United States and based in Mexteo, operationally in other areas in
Latin America, there ie some merit, at least in theory, to the proposal in
2a of reference. Although one of the basic factors in the make-up of any
surveillance team is that ite mexbers mist be indigenous to the area of op-
eration, it would be possible to recruit such a team as suggested in 2a and
use this team in Mexico. However, I believe this would be time-consuming and

very expensive for the following reasons:

a. Machine rune have already been made to spot candidates within
the Agency of the Mexican/American type for the LIMESA/LIMUST project, with

negative results,

b. In order to make it attractive to young men of the caliber
desired, we would have to offer some kind of a career with a starting salary

of somewhore between the GS 7 and GS 9 level, plus travel and allowances,
without attempting to even estimate this cost one can see that. tha figures for

a team of fifteen would run into six digits,

ce. It would take a minisum of three months for a recruiter to move
A4nto the southwest area and spot, contact, develop and recruit a team of a

fifteen. c ered

seer
d. Oncn a team of suitable candidates was recruited, it would
then teke a minimum of another three months to train these candidates in
basic trade craft and surveillance techniques,

e. Upon completion of the training period, the candidates would
have to be moved individually into the area of operztion to become familiar
with this area, the language, people, and atmosphere in general, etc. This

would take another three months minirum,

f. After completion of the ares familiarization period, the tean
would have to be assembled and put through various surveillance exercises as
a unit to check them out prior to actual operations

SEGEFT

an SECRET

-2- i

Ge Taere would be other problems confronting such a team from a
security standpoint, such as cover credentials, which would always pose a
threat to the operation. ?

2. To-sum up, it would appear that the proposal in 2a of reference’
ts not feasible because of the time and experise involved plus the always
latent security haeard. - .

3. 1 agree with paragraph 2 b of reference. Not only should the
personnel of the surveillance team te recruited at the station, but as ocut-
lined in paragraph 3 it should be relatively easy to find suitable candidates.
For example it is proposed under the new LIEMPTY project (this consists of
the remainder of the non-blown LIPSTiCKs and the LIJERSEYs) to recruit a
physical surveillance team. ‘Two of the station's outstanding indigenous
agents, Scantling and Gerende, are ander this project and both are capable
of spotting, developing, and recruiting agents,

4, I agree with paragraph 3b, c, and d, and believe that Headquarters
should make every effort to find an experienced end competent case officer
to fill Clower's slot as the outside surveillance case officer.

' Ly October 1958

MEMORANDUM FOR: CWH ;
SUBJECT: Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico

_. 1,-.On & October 1958 a meeting of representatives of SR Division
and- or Staff was held, attended by the undersigned, to discuss means for
building up physical surveillance assets in Mexico, The SR and CI repre-
sentatives pointed out that their current and projected work on BOMORNING
and their cases requires a considerable strengthening of physical surveile
lance assets, and it was the consensus that these assets would be used
far into the future on Soviet targets, It was further agreed that since
the LIPSTICK operation has encountered difficulties "this year, new assets

should be sought. i

2. Various approaches to the problen wera discussed, the most viable
of which wera as follows:

a, Recruiting of teams or basic elements for teans ain the Mexican
colonies of tho southwestern U. S,

b, Dispatch of a new case officer to Mexico with the sole and
specific duty of developing and running tho new teams,

ce, A combination of a and b,

3, Initdally, it is believed the dispatch of a naw case officer to
Mexico would be tho most successful and give the best immediate results,

for the following reasons:

a. Headquarters and Station records contain the names of munerous
cleared contacts of contacts who could be cleared and through whoa
introductions could be made tv persons suitable for surveillance work.
Hitherto these have not been fully exploited owing to the heavy workload
on Station personnel and the unimpaired functioning till recently of
the LIPSTICK group, Some of these contacts were felt out as recruiters
ard apottors in years past but the matter was never pushed since the
need waa not so great as now,

b. A now case officer is needed beacause the present Station staff
is still too busy to devote the amount of time nesded to build carefully

and train thoroughly the new assets,

ce The new assets will require the full time direction and
coordination of a case officer who has no other responsibilities, In
this connection, it would be advisable to try to select, train and
utilize at least twelve new agents as soon as possible,



--- Page 176 ---
14-00000

224

d, In brief, a replacement of the former physical surveillance
leader is indicated, but a more mature and competent case officer is

needed.

4, Plan a, recruitment in the U, S., should not be dismissed fron
consideration, It would take longer than the other plan but might be
beneficial in enabling the new agents to be trained in the U.S. ‘hey
would then have to spend time getting into Mexico and familiarize thenselves
with operations and operational clizate there, This plan, however, presents
@ problem as to who is to do the recruiting and training in the U, S.

SR Divieion has offered to be of whatever assistance they can, but there
is no indication they could do any better at this than WID,

So It may be of interest to you to know that the SR representatives
said the best work done anywhere in the world on the BOMORNING case, which
has wide international ramifications, was done. by LIKAYAK-2 in Mexico,

FROM «Chief of Station, Mexico |

1. On 16 December 1955 the daily check of property which this Station
may dssire to use for operational purposes(LICOOL run} showad that a
house adjacent to the LIMERICK target installation was vacant. LIPSTICK-19
was contacted immediately to investigate the propérty. He repurted that
it was a one-story house(duplex) in very poor condition which was being
repaired by the omer for rental. He furtner reported that from the
maid's room on the roof a clear view of tha entire LINERICK compound was:
possible and, if he had understood the LIMERICK language, he would hava
been able to understand several conversations which vere going on between
LIMEKICK officers in the game area of the compound, LIPSTICA-19 also ree
ported that from the roof of this house it was a distance of only approxt-
mately fifty feet to the LIMERICK building across fat roofs with no
obstructing partitions except for a small wall and several strands of
barbed wire, all totalling about four or five feet righ between the last
roof and the LIMERICK building.

2. Based upon this favorable report, reference A was sent immediately
to Headquarters requesting authorization to rent the house, Two days
later reference 5 was received granting approval to rent the house. Con~
sequently, LIPSTICK-2 (the only cleared married man available tc the
Station, with the exception of LIBERTY, wno would fit into the area) was
approached and requested to rent the house. This cused a considerable
problem to LIPSTICK-21, since the house has only two cedrooms and he already
had two children, and at that very time his wife was in the hospital
iving birth to a third child. Further, he had a very comfortable house
fa duplex waich he shared with ois brother-in-law at a pre-devaluation
rent) which he would never be able to again acquire after tnis operation
was terminatec. He did, however, agree to take the house and it was

apparent to all concerned that ‘nis decision was based upon loyalty to
tiis Station and dedication to the fight asainst Communism. It is hoped
that this unselflon snd devoted act of LIPSTICX-21's will be made a

matter of permanent record.

“3. The reason for LiPSiICK-21 to move from very comfortable quarters

at less rent into cramped quarters at a higher rental]. needed some explana-
tion for his friends and relatives. There is a very fine private school
approximately one block from this house which LIPSTICK-21 had often men=
tioned as the best in the city for his children, and consequently he told
everyone that the reason for moving was to be as close as possible to this
School so that his cniliren could attend. It should be noted in this
respect that, in reality, LIYSTICK-21 had been sending his children to

one of the best public schools in Mexico City at no cost. Unier the present
circumstances, he will have to pay tuition at the private school because
it is the only decent school in the area ami it provides excellent cover
for his residence in the area. It 1s requested that Headquarters authorize
this Station to assist LIPSTICK-21 in the payment of his chiliren's tuition
for the above stated reasons. Approximate cost of the tuition would be
$20.00 U.S. per child por month, or a total for LIPSTICK-21 of $10,00 US
per month, Authorization is requested to asyist LIrsTICK-21 by payment

of 330,00 U.S. per month.

4. The house is ore of @ series of one-story houses that extend fron
the LIMERICK building to a four-story apartment building on the far
corner. The fronts of the houses are all directly on the sidewaik with
the doors opening onto a one-step stoop. The backs of the houses and the
walls of the back patios all abut the compound of the LIMERICK installa-
tion. The rear windows of the house face a patio which ends in a brick
wall. ‘his brick wall is not as hijn as the roof of the house, ending
about: four feet below the level of the roof. There are stairs which
ascend from this patio to the roof where the maid's quarters are situated,
About halfway up these stairs one can turn and obtain an unrestricted
view of the LIMERICK compound, tlowever, tha maid's room offers tae best
operational possibilities since it provides concealment for the observer
and his equipment, plus a more advantageous view. LIPSTICK-21 told his
maid that she would have to sleep out at a local pension since ne needed
her room for nis radio exveriments, This is a plausible story since
LIPSTICK-21 is known to be an enthusiastic radio amateur.

S. The maid's room nas a door that faces across the roofs in the direction
of the LIMERICK installation and one window wiich faces across the house
roof toward the street. A view of the LIMERICK compound is obtained by

an observer who is tack in the room looking through the partly opened door,
Some better method of observation will be worked out wnich will eliminate
the security hazard of a door partially opened at all times of operation,

6, At present we p.lan to allow LIPSTICK-21 considerable time to get

en settled securely into his new quarters before starting any operational
efforts, Aiter this waiting period is over anawe feel that we can
Securely comence ope:‘ations, we plan on using the base for the following

efforts:

, @. A Supplementary photographic base. In tais connection the
request for adiitional Exactas and spotting scopes previously made
; should be expedited. It is anticipated that much oper atiorwSinforma-
ii tion will be develozed by this photograshic work showing the various
associations between the people when they are at play in the compound
| waich can never be determined from the LIPSTICK-LIMITED coverage.
4] Visiters who seldoa leave the compound do engage in social activity
within the compound and can be phctographed for possible identifica-
tion by the AEDIPPSRS. Items wiich are losded into the automobiles
fer transportation to unknown points may te identified through this
coverase. Further, snould LIPSTICK/LINITED be terminated for any
reason, we would be able to continue some coverage from this base.

~ bd. Observation by LIPSTICK-21 of the builaings and the activitdes
in the compound will furnish valuable information on the daily Livimg
habits of the residents and their guests,

Ce ‘the LIPSTICK/LIDOMINO base, presently being occupied by LINCH-
FIN, is about 75 yards away from the LIMERICN target while LIPSTICK,’
LICALLA is only about fifty feet. This base may assist the Head-
quarters technicians, who periodically use the LIPSTICX/LIDOMIN
base, for reasons of proximity and the use of tneir equipment from
a different direction. The exact use of the LIFSTICX/LICALIA base
in this respect mst be determined by the Headquarters technicians
who are familiar with tne equipment used,

ad.  Comersations in the LIMERICK compound are audible to someone
whe is listening from the maid's room, Naturally street noises and
extraneous sounds interfere considerably wits tuis eavesdropping so
that the employment of some Parabolic microphones ami recorder must
“be used for optimum results.

e. Should future operations provide the crpgortunity to install a
transnitter micropnone (resonant cavity) in some item carried into
the LIMGRICK target, LIPS TICK/LICALLA would serve as an excellent
base since it has direct line of sigmt to the back of the LIMERICK

target.

f£, Prelimina-y investigation reveals that the possibility does
exist that phy: f.cal access may be obtained to the LIMERICK target
from LIPSTICK/LiCALIA. This investigation will be intensified and
a full report, togetner with available photograjhs, will be sent to
Headquarters for study by FEARSON and NILES as to the feasibility

of this type of operation.

7. As stated in pars zraphs two and three above, LIPSTICK-21 has undergone
cor.siderable personal .tacrifice to accommodate this Station in this opera-
tion. It has always been the practice to pay a base house operator &
starting salary of approximately $120.00 U.S, per month, since the work

of operating a base hous is almost full-time. LIPSTEICK-21 now earns
864.00 U.S, for work of approximately four hours per day, It is therefq_re
requested that this Station Le authorized by catle to increase the salary ~
of LIFSTICK-21 to $120,00 U.S. per month.
