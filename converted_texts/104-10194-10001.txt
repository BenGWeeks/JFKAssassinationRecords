Thene's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff - just an averaze joe trying to make
a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicdity to meke use of a saleable
articles knowledge of fiussian, Physically he's sort of scft, tends to be over-
weicht = he's about 5'8"tall, -ard about 190 in weight. ‘is personality is on
the negative side, his manner dull. : .

Tarasoff was greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Govern-
ment, He wants that security. And ke has about reached end of the line
salary wise as a maintenance man or tuilding surcrintendent. Tarasoff is will-
ing to work in D.C, but insists on a GS 7 because he “29 to support a wife and -
two children, le does not mind.the sedentary aspects of Froject Letail - I
doutt if he'd be interested in anything that wasn't sedentary. He also liked the
the other aspects of Detail and I would think, from talxing with him that he
dould be quite able to handle a job on Netail. He can translate ~ reads with -

’ a great deal of ease. His PHS I notiee indicated he's interested only in o/s =

for him to work effectively with an absolute minimum of supervision.

; Sponds instinctively to items of operational significance, and his
experience and knowledge aake it possible for him to write penetrating
analyses of target personalities, and interrelationships among these

persons, based solely on what he hears.
This officer has also been called upon to transcribe material from
audio operations, in addition to the telephone material which is his

“ normal assignment. He has also handled this well, although his advan-

cing age and less acate- hearing make this task much more difficult
for him...

While not called upon to use Spanish normally, he has sufficient
fluéney to handle material in Spanish when required.

‘This officer uses his time well and takes good care of the equip-

he have any supervisory responsibilities.

. Subject has not been in a supervisory position and his
present assignment outside on unofficial cover working as
a loner gives no indication as to his supervisory ability. .
It is believed Subject probably serves best as an independent
analyst without supervisory responsibilities.

Subject has continued to demonstrate a very ntgh level of

. interest and competence in his work, Beyond the relatively technical
aspect. of produciag transcriptions, which hé'gacomplishes with time-
liness, accuracy and thoroughness, he. strives to provide the Station

“ and Headquarters with an insight in depth on the local Soviet com-
‘plement. He does this capably, particularly when one understands
the limitations of his technical access. His wife, a contract em-
ployee, assists him in the preparation of the technical product.

_ However, her over-all contribution goés beyond this, since Subject
“and his wife work together in effort to distill the meaning of their
product interms of personality. assessment. They are uniquely well

adjusted to their deep cover circumstances, are of little burden
administratively to the Station, and are presently interested in
continuing their assignment in Mexico City indefinitely,

+ Reads Russian rapidly and looks out for material of interost to others as he
scans. Is adaptable and flexible and handles several different technical fields with
equal facility. Can tackle almost any subject without previous experience and turn out
a good job. His native knowledge of Russian is of considerable benefit to the whole
section. Selects the salient points from masses of ugéless or repetitive material with
intelligent judgment, and compiles reports which are pointed and concise. His only
deficiency. of any consequence is the slight awkwardness and occasional lack of clarity
nis written English style. His English has improved cecrsideratly during the past two
ears, but sometimes the failure to use the most precise term or the right connective
complicates for the reader a conception which is verfectly clear to the writer.

30 November 1970. Your approval is requested for him to
use the attached employment history.

2.°. For your information, we have been advised by the
Mexico City Station that once Mr. Tarasoff has retired to

relationships, he will probably not be asked to go into
any detail about his past cover jobs that would require
anyone to call upon these firms for backstopping confirma~

retirement activities that might require checking into his
past, Mr. Tarasoff will contact Headquarters for instruc-
tions. :

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT _ 3’ Retirement Planning

i

\ .
1, The established policy of the Agency favors carly retirement of
its employees who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when
they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement
deserves serious thought and planning, and you should therefore know
that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records,

during November, 1970.

2. Planning ahead-can bring about, with each passing year, definite
progvess taward.your.retirement goals. The Agency is anxious to assist
you in planning for your retirement. It is even more important, as an
ernployee, ‘that you begin now to plan for this occasion.

3. You deserve to know as much as possible about the general subject
of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself,
your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other
employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available
on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory
service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date

of your eligibility.

4. You are requested to call the Executive Secretary of the Board,
Mr. Howard G. Phillips, on extension 6872 to arrange an appropriate time
to diacuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon

retirement.
