3. VIERA Linares serves as Charge d'Atfaires in the absence of .
Ambassador ALARCON Quesada, Up to this point, neither the Base nor LNERGO
have been able to state evidentially as to whether VIERA or JIMENEZ Escobar

is the sucessor to Chafik Homero.SAKER Zeénni (left PCS October 1967) as the .
DGI Station Chief, We both, however, tend to regard JIMENEZ as car rying the
most weight in terms of operational activity and in terms of effectiveness, Now,
with the arrival of BOZA Hidalgo-Gato (who reportedly has been the deputy to
Ramon OROZA Naveran, head of U.S. operations for the DGI, per our last
“.information), it remains to be seen if BOZA figures higher in the local hierarchy
than VIERA or JIMENEZ. With JIMENEZ, VIERA, BOZA, and PRENDES
“Gutierrez, the local DGi station has more ranking talent than has been the norm,
The Cubans do not necessarily slot their intelligence officers in Mission titles
equivalent to their true ranks and responsibilities, oo °
