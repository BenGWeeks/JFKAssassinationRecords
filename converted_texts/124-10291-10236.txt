POSITION WAS IMPROVING: (A MILITIA CAPTAIN WAS RECENTLY -
SENTENCED TO’ 30.YEARS IN PRISON FOR PASSING ARMS TO. THE MRP).
NO HELP. WHATSOEVER HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE
FROM THE "SOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHO PROVIDED SUPPORT
FOR THE INVASION", THESE.SOURCES WERE STILL THINKING
INEFFECTUALLY. IN TERMS OF A FURTHER INVASION. a,
J, THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF: THE RESISTANCE IN CUBA TOWARDS
THE EXILES WAS ONE-OF INDIFFERENCE MOUNTING TO CONTEMPT FOR
SPECIFIC MOVES SUCH AS THE PROPOSED PROMOTION OF A CUBAN GOVT y

IN EXILE. WHAT THE RESISTANCE WANTED WAS FUNDS AND THE RETURN,

BY INFILTRATION, OF TRAINED EXILES, PARTICULARLY COMMUNICATION
EXPERTS. , ,

"NOT LAST ANOTHER. YEAR. HE ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN CUBA : ues
