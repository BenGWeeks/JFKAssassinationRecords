1. On 10 aides. ihe SEBLI-< provided the details “of fi Es February

. Meeting with Jose Luis’ SROGAKCEL Ordonez ({20)-140.:5), leader of the Guatemalan.
Communist Party (F3T) exile organization in Mexico. LIREBEL-2 reported that he
arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2000 hours on the étn, and found HALCAPCEL about
to leave. BALCARCEL requested that LIPEEEL-2 taxe nim to a garaze where his
ear was being repaired, which LIREBEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready,
BALCARCEL asked LIRESEL-2 to drive hin toa meeting which he had scheduled for
2100 hours with his "Soviet contact." (Note: BALCARCEL had previously told
LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his sontact in the Soviet Emtessy.) LIREBEL-2
and BAICARCEL drove to the "Parque Escondido," also xnowm as the "Parque tuindido,”
lorated on Insurgentes Sur between Gomez varias and Millet Streets. LIREPEL-2
parked and BALCARCEL held his meeting with his "Soviet contact" standing on the

., sidewalk of Gomez Faries Street bordering en the park, ‘The meeting lasted for
30 minutes, ‘ : .

. +. 2, BALCARCEL comented after re-joining LIRESEL-2 that his "Soviet contact"
had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received
from a Guatemalan student. ‘he student rad asked to talk to the Soviet by true
- hame and asked hin for some information on the Soviet national soccer team, which
~ is scheduled to play some games in Guatezala. Tne Soviet told BALCARCEL that he
had told the student that he could not provide any current infor=ation on this’ -
subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador,
where the team was to play some games.prior to their arrival in Giatemla, ~. ~
BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for hin by
true name, and he speculated that the University Students: Association (AEU) leader
who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving
-his name out to unauthorized persons. : . -

distance telephone call fros Guatemala. The operator asked for KOSTIZOV
by mare, then told the caller “ir. HONTENEGEO, I have your call to Hezico |
ready". When EOSTIKOVY came to the phone, the caller stated be wag call- i
ing: oa behalf of the Custemalan University Students Organization, but did
not further identify himself. The caller end KO&STIEOV discussed the USSE
}mational soccer team and its scheduled appearance in Guatemala. EKOSTIZOY
stated he was not certain exactly what date the team was scheduled to
arrive in Guatemala, and suggested that the caller centact the scecer
federation in Bl Salvador, where the team-would be playing prior to its
arrival in Guatemala, The caller also inquirod whether there was any in-
formation on the Ballet. (Referonce) 8bd@ vas told that there was noac.

. 2. it should be. noted that normally queries concerning the Bovict
soceer tean or the appearance of n Russias Ballet troupe would be

handled by one of the Cultural or Sports Affairs officers of the Embassy.
KOSTIZOV's participation in these matters, es. reported above, would see «}«
to confira previous Station reporting that KOSTIKOV handies dealings he-
tween the Soviet Eabasoy in Mexico and Guatemalan leftist organizations.

car was being repaired, which LIZEBEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car vas not ready,
RALCARCEL esced LIRZBEL-2 to drive hia to @ meting which he had scheduled for
2100 hours with his “Soviet contact.” (Hote: BALCARCEL hed previously told

parked and BALCAKCEL held his meeting with his ‘Soviet contact” standiag on the

sidewalk ef Gomez Farias Street bordering oa the park. The meeting lasted for
 ofummtes. - . :

2. EALCARCEL commented after re-Joining LIREBEL-2 that Als “Soviet contact”

where the team was to play some gazes prior to their arrival in Quatemla. cue
BALCARCEL eaid that the Soviet was angry that thia student hed asked for hia by ©

KOSTIKOV received a long distance call on 6 February in, which the cc.i-Teation
conformed exactly to that’ ‘deacribed by BALCAICRL to LIAEBEI-2 in paragragh 2

Mexico, and siailarly with Lorenzo ZELAYA Romero (201~0+5172), & Honduran :

his hote] room at.a pre-rrranzed hour using a telephone cede ~

Subject of 201-266115, with whoa ho has re-cstablishca a good
social relationship. Through Subject: of 201-265115 he also

met Subject of 201~-276184, Cnicf of the Referenturs In
addition to serving as an accces agent to Subject of 201-268115,
he has fulfilled spot requircs2nts such as providing information
on Centro Intercultural de Docunentacion (CIDOC) and

the reporting period, ach reeting date is established at
the preceding meeting and no furthcr contact or confirmation is
required, LICOWL-1 arrives by bus at a car pick-up point and
is then driven by the case officer to a small coffee shop

- where he reviews his diary with the case officer. Due to the
mature of his job and the level of his access, LICOWL-1l: is not
in a position to do nove currently than to report on the brief
encountors he has with HIHARSHers who come into his store, His

- reparts normally consist of his assessment of: personalitics,
description of new arrivals and, occasionally, biographic

information he has becn able to pick up.- He. also gives. tinely

reports of demonstrations and other unusual activity in the
vicinity of the HMHEARSH installation,

dad, LIEMPTY~3; LIENPTY-3 is met at irregular intervals at
various out-of-the-way restaurants for the purpose of briefing
and debriefing on operational assignments and discussion of his
written xeports., Keetings are arranged by: phone using open
code, His most recent assignuent has. been.the development,
assessment, and recruitment of 201-810981, LIEXPTY-3 has ‘few
peers at the art of developing an operational lead, but his
extensive operational activity in past years against the LEWVARSII
‘target has required that he be used sparingly, selectively,
and always under alias. Development of 201-810981 has been
his only assignmént during the reporting pericd, and LIEPTY-3
made good early progress, Purporting to. be the representative
of a film club for architects, LIEHPTY-3 was able to get 201-
810981 to agree to become a consultant, Thereafter, LIZ:PTY-3

_ continued to ask questions about 201-81C0981's work, te the point
‘where 201-810981 realized that more than a filn club for .
architects was involved.. At this point it was decided to.let
LIEWPTY-3 break cover; recruit 201-810981 to supply information
on the work of his office (but not--at this point--the people
‘in his office), and continue to handle. him. until the recruitment
‘was firm and previous questions about the’ stability and
reliability of 201-810981 hed been resolved, This was done,

. and 201-S10981 accepted recruitment, knowing that WOLADY
intelligence was involved. LIEW TY-3 Leld several meetings with
201-8169S51 after recruitment, and countersurveillance did not
reveal any signs of NHHARSH surveillance. For about a month,
however, LIEWPTY-3 hus not. been able to contact 201-810981,.
and it is possible that-the latter. has developed cola feet,

If LIEWPTY-3 can reestablish contact, he will continue to

‘e. =LIRCCKET=1;

1) LIROCKET-1 is met monthly, tine and place arranged
‘at the previous meeting. During these weetings he is debriefed
on his twice-weekly teaching rcssions at the MUHALSH Embassy,
His regular student has been the Subject of 201-028975, and he
has had oceasional dealings with other LITiARSHers, particularly
AESEASICK, The meetings with 201-020063 bave not been. of
particular interest, and we had been waiting impatiently for
the latter's replacement to arrive, so that LIROCKET-1 would
have a better target to work on. It was LINOCKET-1 who
came up with the Lirst local confirmation of the identity of
this replacenent (MEXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969). Dealings
with AESDASICK have been concerned with attempts by the
director of the school where LINCCKET-1 teaches to borrow
sociological films frem the MHHARSH film office,

2) It now appears, however, that LIROCKET-1 has
reached the end of the line. For some tive he has ‘been involved
ina rather messy divorce action, and in August LIROCKET-1
reported that his wife had denounced hin to Mexican authorities
‘. aS an RVROCK agent (a few months previously,’ she had denounced ~
him as an NMITHARSH agent). LINOCKET-1 was not inclined..to take
his wife's. ravings:too seriously sinco he. considered ‘hor slightly
nuts, However, LIENVOY reported that on 16 September 1969
LIROCKET-1's wife called 201-028975 and told him she had to see hin
urgently on something of extreme interest about her husband.
201-028975 told hex to come to the Embassy, which she did, and
she presunably repeated her accusation, Since that tine,
LIROCKET~1 has received a polite brush-off. Ie has been told
that the HHIIARSH Embassy has run out of funds for English -
“language training, and that there would.-be..no. more ‘lessons .° .
unless. 201-025975's replacement, ox the nev Ambassador (when
and if. one arrives). wanted to rehiro him. He was told,
however, to check in regularly, and he was given, as usual, .
an invitatiou to the annual MHHARSH national day reception (he
did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKET-1 has not spoken
with 201-028575 since his wife's visit~--all dealings have been
through AEPOLYP, swho has for some time been the paymaster for
LIROCKET~1,

SNES ME ND ct PLA SOE RR ETN fT OR a Sac e PTT eT

rast

3) \LIROCKET~1 was not aware of his wife's visit, and
even after the case officer, without telling him that we knew
of the visit, brought LIROCKET-1 around to the conclusion that”
she might have done this, he still does not think that she
spilled the beans to 201-028975. (It is apparent that the -

_ MHBARSHers, whether or. not they believe Mrs. LIROCKET=1's
story, have concluded that LIROCKET-1 represents a-.security.
hazard, and they are sinply going to drop him. LIROCKET-1
will continue to press the MHHARSHers for an answer regarding
his future with them, and if, as suspected, they ‘keep putting
him off, he will be instructed to break contact and. he will be
terminated by the Station.)

4) Other than the blowing of LIROCKET-1 hisself,

little damage has been cone. The wife has never seen the current
case officer and knows none of the meeting .arrangenents or other

LIROCK:T since his wife's conversation with 201~028575, and
there have been no Signs of HHEARSE surveillance.

f. DUPETAL~1: ‘She has been net usekly for a total of ©

13 times during the period. -eeting hours are prearranged and
the location is alucys a safehousc. er normal functioa has
been to report on the activitics ‘at the DMLET installation
where she is cmplo;cd as the secretary to the PYLET Anbassador.
In‘addition, che performed g£oue casing and, investigation in

“ pupport of the AETAKEOFF audio operation, Since the DMLET
target is of low priority, DIPETAL-1 has been attemptiag to
increasc her usefulness to us by trying to obtain a job in
the office of the President of the PRI, the ruling political
party, with excellent prospects for success.

@. LISACK=2;, Until he lost his job in ‘Septenber, he vas
ws the resident administrator of the apartuent building in which
han both AEWENGER and AEUALSTNO reside, Meetings were held bi-weekly
for a total of four tines, pre-arranged by telephone eall .
several days in advance to his office in a publishing firm.
Meeting location was a restaurant/cafe and meetings nornally
lasted about thirty minutes, He provided information on the
activities of these two MIMARSHers anc their families, license
plate numbers, and descriptions of visitors. .

bh, LISACK-4: He is the portero of the apartment building
in which Subject of 20)-305870 resides, Ne-maintains a daily
log of the movements and activities of this and other !i4IARSHers,
and he reports the license plates and description of visitors
to the building, He was met weekly for a total of 12 tines,
always in a small restaurant within walking distance of the
downtown office where he works a half day. Meeting hours aro
pre-arranged. to permit LISACK-4 to attend on the way to or
from this second job, He compensates for his lack of fornal
education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural
intelligence and cooperation,

i. LISACK-6; He is the portero of the building in which
_ Subjects of 201-837203 and 201-788861 (who took the apartment
of Subject of 201~205304) reside. Ke naintains a daily log
of these two MIHARSHers, their families and visitors, He was
met 12 times during the *period. Since hevcannot.be absent fron
the building for over thirty minutes without arousing suspicion,
meetings are always. for a brief ten minutes and are held ina
nearby’ park, As has been reported, the case officer who handles
-. LISACK-6 became the target of unknown surveillance in August,
and again in October, following meetings with LISACK-6. The
' Station believes that the surveillance was accidental, in that
the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by "male and
female prostitutes and other undesirable characters. In any
event, LISACK~6 has been put on ice, to be revived if the
occupants of his building become higher priority targets.

j. LISACK-7; She was not met during the reporting period.

. She remains a "reserve asset" for special requirements in the

- realestate field for such potential uses as safehouse rental,
«key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed. Although
there: is no immediate requirement for her talents, we would.
like to maintain her Operational Approval so that she can be

Plans

a. There are several assets of the REVTOP section who
have been carried uncer SB/COA for a fairly long period of |
tine. Since the targets of their access change from time to
time, as well as the nature of the information they provide,
we do not believe they warrant special or new projects to
cover thea, We do believe, hovever,. that they chould be
brought under a project to facilitate orderly reporting and
administration without resorting to separate progress reports
on each.

b. Since their activities closely parallel those of
assets already covered by LISACZ, we belicve it would be
logical to include LIAODBIN-1 and -2, LIORDER-1 and Subject

of 201-843659 (on whoa we are awaiting an Operational Approval)
in this Project. Although none of these is paid a salary,

such a change will require some cost amendment to the Project
to account for minor operational cxpenses which have heretofore
been charged to SB/O0A. Separate correspondence will follow
on these assets, - . .

c, There are several additional assets currently in the
developmental stage who may eventually be administered under
LISACK, These include Subject of HMMA$37742 of 28 August 1969,
targetted against ALPOL Subject of 201-851552, targetted |
against ALMERGER; Subject ‘or 201-848881, currently in sceial
contact with. Subjects of 201-250583 and "201-02 20668 under
Station direction; and Subject of 201-859225, who reports on
his-contacts with Subjects of 201-305052 and "201-744341,
among othcr MHHARSHers.

SOVIET EXBASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE
STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

.by Carlos Montiel .
' Source: La Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 May 1969, San Jose,
‘ Costa Rica :
Mexico City -- In.a letter addressed ‘to our editorial
department Peruvian. newsmen informed me that, being acquainted.
{ ~~ -with my article “Ahora Peru" [Now Peru], they asked that country's

chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade

'. mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important

“mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation. wetiae es . = :

In that article Tobsorved that menibers of the Soviet’

; ~ enbassy in Mexico City had ‘predicted in that. city's social .

: 7 circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diporatic :
relations with the Krealin at the embassy level.

"According to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lina daily

= La Prensa confirned with prominent play the report that I had made.

’. an El Universal Grafico whose substance I had obtained thanks to"
he. indiscretion of Soviet diplomats’ included. in the "cocktail ; :
circuit" organized here arong the ambassadors and trade re resentatives

of foreign coun’ tries.

officials began their spree "between glasses of expensive wines
in the 'red! district of Mexico City but had ‘to bring their

- adventure to a close at Ciudad Victoria amidst the abuse they %

us hurled: at Mexico under the diplomatic immunity which they enjoyed."
Apparently, the Soviet diplomats not only have given up decent beha

: | ~ ~ . but are also demonstrating their incompetence. : e

; . The Peruvian chancellor, Hercads, Jarrin, who announced the .

whether the government has decided to take that step" ‘(of establish-..

TIPSY DIPLO?

Bab yee say . ..
“This is the amusing story of a "spree" which began in
the frosty dawn of 12 December among bubbles of expensive
wines in the "red Light” district of Mexico City and reached
its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are
“involved are two Marxist-Leninists fron the. Soviet Union who,
on breaking the chains of disgraceful tyranny weizhing on
: . respectable diplomats, "tanked up” in rourgeois bars, not in

order to cheer up and forget some sorrowful, “episode or other

_that nawed at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of

cee

abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext |
: that when ore 13 "tipsy" everything thet he does is absolved. .

‘The diplomats” of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valez ery

‘ stikov, ‘second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovshkin, attache,

not only forgot among hippies thes‘sociaiist ethics in order to

indulfe in a "small drink among those wio are in the limelight” ~

custozary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine"

drove the Hussians to the worst extremes of crudeness exr102icc

without any of the "academic bearing" that the Frierdship Doo, , las

Univer sity of Moscow notes as the cajor assets acquired by the

progressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on

the Mexicans.

-., The four PEMEX. engineers, as any well-born sons would

. have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon,

the Hussians suddenly became transformed into diplox rate gunmen; .

brandishing their weapons at the engineers. However, no douzt-

because Russians are better at getting ready to ‘handle remote-

-~ controlled spaceships directed at the moon than. in the skilful:

discharge of .prosaic pistols, they found thenselve s disarmed ¢

short order by the Mexicans.

2. It Is Interesting to noze that LICOWL-! describes KOSTIKOV as follows:
He Is a man who would do anything to anybody. He ts without morals, education
_ or manners, H+ uses foul language and has no respect for others, When
KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-I's) es:ablishment, wlth Sovlet women present,
KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees,
while thetr husbands are present, and thinknozhing of it, According to LICOWL-1,
the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this, (Comment: However, from
a recent LICOWL-1 tape, lt appears that Yurly Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV,
GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative
employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIANOV)
was going to say-something-to KOSTIKOV - someday.--but had no: sald a word'to - .

Valerly Vladimtrov' tch KOSTIKOV |
+ Valerty Viadimtrovich KOSTIKOV is approximately 3 35 years of age,
corpulent and paunchy, with a round somewhat fleshy face that sports a
~ "5 o'clock shadow,- and wears oversized tinted glasses in dark heavy frames, a .

- * _ whlch partially obscure a pal of small,. but plercing eyes.,. H's heavy jowls, o

thin Itps, wide nosirlls and dark hair add to an inpresston that his features

“are more of a Semitic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav, A
shapeless dark sult-coat, carelessly put over a whire shirt, with unbuttoned ; .
collar, through which protrudes a :uft of dark halr com lete a photograph ot

: Valerly Viadimtrovich KOSTIKOV, Attache ot the Consular Office and
. Identlfted member of the KGB, ; oo _
“* KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico In December 1961 and assumed his duties:
48 an attache at the USSR Coasulate at the Sovlet Embassy tn Mexico City,
_ Owing to his extrovert nature and propensity for drinking, he soon acquired _
several “buddies” of simtlar background and with similar tastes, Among :
‘these individuals, his closest assoclates have been, or still are, the-following: *
Vitaly Borisovich SHUBIN, Attache and Identified member of the KGB, who .
lef for the USSR in July 1964; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Corres-
; pondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR tn October 1964; and Oleg.

: _,, Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO, Vice-Consul and idearified member of the Kos,

who [is still in Mexico, and who has accept K KOSTIKOV into his circle of :

However, [t was mostly with SHUBIN and. ALFERIYEV that KOSTIKOV

uy felt entirely ac ease, Meny a tlme KOSTIKOV would taik to-elther one.of

“ them cn the phone and indulge In a friendly exchange of obscealtles, where-
as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO In a Like: menner, even though. .
Q, . KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house, KOSTIKOV
= developed'an exceedingly close relattonship with SHUBIN. They used:to
Poo Regen bows travel together to varlous parts of the country and to spead time together 1
_with thelr familles at the Casino de la Selva, hotel in Cuernavaca, But
it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTINOV's
attentions, An embittered acrimonious woman, Roza, who despised her

* husband and had a flerce hated for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed Into

_ 4 different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone In his
best unctuous and" lngratlacloit manner, It ts impossible ro say whether they
. had sexual relations, bat the obvious and strong sexual overtones in Roza's

_volce led one to Presume that she had more than just-a frtendiy Interest in


--- Page 153 ---
14-0000

. whfe Roza has a tolerant.attlrude towards KOSTIKOV's probable incur-

gions Into the domain of mdital infidelity, stice, on one occasion,

7 waen KOSTIKOV had been Invited to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV ‘s
home, and Roza KOS’ TIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV agalust
drinking too much, a womzn answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV

-'to the phone, When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV It sounded that she was more
peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that . .
other women were present there at the tlme,

* When KOSTIKOV atarted talking to his wife on this particular call, he

- “already had had a few drinks and In disguised volce spoke to her In Spanish, . -

French and English, possibly to lmpress those who were present, His
Spanish is quite good and fluent, his French is rather tolerable, but his
English ts somewhat sttlted and of a school-room type. Possibly, he studied
_ these languages at the Moscow Institute of Languages,
; _ This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOY. a great latitude for: making “
' friends among Mexicans and his easy-going earthy approach ts presumably .
‘ » of considerable help to hlm in developing contacts, Since his consular
, “dutles are quite negligible, he can easily engage tn this sort of activity.
In fact, this neglect of officlal duties promp:ed a heated argument between
: . NECHIPORENKO and the vistring Soviet correspondent Timar GAYDAR,


--- Page 154 ---
“who declared tha: osténsibly the covisiilar staft does not preform any useful

function, but just loafs around, H's assertion has been confirmed in part
by the attitude of this particular group of Soviet Embassy employes, who
quite often seek some diversion of a non- Intellectual type. Thus, on one
occasion, when a group of Soviet tourlst:has a brlef stay tn Mexlo, one of.
them -a woman, compla, ined during a phone call to the Embassy that 7
KOSTIKOV and Leonid Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, Intourtst representative
In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROY's apartment in
order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourlsts without any
. Anformation about thelr next move and letting them shift for themselves,
Stnce the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has eared
- to “cultivate” NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potential drinking companion, :-
: ‘and has been talking to him on the phone a number of times recently In quite
a familiar tone of voice, It seems that. NIKIFOROV, a younger: man, Is
’ being Influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree, Ss
KOSTIKOY's famtly life does no:-appear:to be-a: stormy one; because bis vs
wife Roza A, sounds easy-going and friendly. She ts. in charge of the Embassy’ 8

learned to drive,

> tg.well trusted to take trips around the country In the company of another :

Soviet Embassy employee on various matters of Importance and, on

occasions, ‘he acts as an interpreter for visiting Soviet officials, His

“tnown physical defect is weak eyes, Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called.up
_ an eye-speciallst for an appotntmenr, because his eyes were troubling him

and that ts prodably the reason for hls wearing tinted glasses, Sometimes

Mexicans refer to him as the man with glasses, It ls quite possible-that an

“auto accident KOSTIKOV had in’ Vera_cruz may have been caused by hls

. ‘somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessaess, ‘However, “

when KOSTIKOV was excusing himself fr tt, GARMASHEV, to whom |

he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that lt was about time KOSTIKOV 7

_ Owing to this shortcoming of: ‘having weak. eyes and his Physical make
up, KOSTIKOV does not participate In varlous Indoor or outdoor sports as a
much asdo other members of the Soviet Embassy. It seems that ‘billiards '°
are about the most strenuous execise that he undertakes. However, it must |
not be surmised that he Is a weak individual ina physical sens? and wil
probably givea good account of himself if a situation will demand i

‘’ Maay of his intimate collaborators call him "Kopchenyy” or "Smoked"

- . which in Russian slang may- mean an individual with a dark skin, or may
refer to the fact ot his wearing tinted glasses, or it mey signify that he went

through a school of hard knoe ks Re
If Is quite certain that KOSTIKOV and ALFERIYEV belong to the same

group of former hool Igans, who by dint of sheer disregird: for meral Q

. standards forged ahead and became “somebodies",

KOSTIKOV seems to be quite unsrupulous, ready to perform any sort
of task set before him, not ina cold and methodical way, bur witha cer- ;
" taln zest and bravado, It appears that he has no moral, religtous, (or ,
ar other type of scruples, He Is vulgar, untidy and lecherous, with ; a
_ penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions In conversation with |
his "buddies", with whom ue drinks quite a lot, circumstances permirting.
: In addition, tt must be noted that he ts a shrewd and resourceful individual

unquestionably loyal to the Communist system.
