A Military Profile !
i

ITCHELL WERBELL Is a short, ;
N wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
Aaiking about communism or other so-
clal Sssues. He has the face and bear.
ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a musiache and
occasionally a moarocle. He often
dress military clothing of Indeter-
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking §n slightly clipped
sentences peppered: with military |
Phrases. There is nothing phony in
this, WerBell has a strong attachment .
to weapons and to warfare, and he has -

“been Bround them so ‘long that the

ideas and styles they foster are an in-
grained part of his personality.

He comes by beth his militarism and
his anticommuntsn honestly. His
“father was: an officer in the Russian
Impdrial army, even thouch he was
born) in the United States. “It was aj
Inicky situation,” says Mitch, “He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days you could do that.”

The elder Werfell fought against;
the Bolsheviks, but before the collapse
of the czarist redime he wiscly secured
An -appuintment*as ‘liaison otficer be-
tween the. Russlan and American
forces—stationed in the U.S. He lived?

he was head ‘of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own,

Ia the mid-'50s, WerBell pulled out
of his agency and then formed his
own publie relattons firm. “I'd already
deen drifting into international PR;
WerBell says, “using my family back-
ground. I had tremendous contacts in

Europe, and I moved into the Far .

East, too.” How much of this inoving
in was milltary, WerBell won't say,
but Nis business :cok on more and
mure vf what he calls a “geopoliiteal”
flavor,

Before long, he was dabbling in
Latin. American dictatorstips. “Before
Fidel took over in Cuba, we were

4 working closely with Batista.” He adds .

with a grin, “Our function was to keep
Batista In power, althouzh the US.

verrment Was looking favorably on
Fidel at that point.” .

Froa alt this, even WerBell doesn't
know evactly how, came a passionate
conecrn about communism. “| decided
to devote whatever time J could to
anticommunist activities,” he says.
At first It was sort of a hobby, but
then il became my main drive In life.
What I'm doing now'—here he ges.
tures at the arsenal on his office walls
“affords me a damned ood Iving.
But the living ts not why I do it.”

The Heart of It
N 1948, WHILE anticommunism was
sul a hobby, albelt a paying hobby,
WerBell purchased the Dobbs estate.
He installed rudimentary design faci

ofthe enemy, and you'll win the fight.
That's a Int of bull. The best way to
get their hearts, if they're the enemy,
is ta shoot ‘em and cut the hearts
out”

While he experimented with weap-
ons—quiclly, to avold problems with
the federals—WerBell proceeded with

vhis personal brand of geopolitics. He

made himself avaitab!e to anticommu-
nist regimes that wanted help in fight-

committee report, “at vanance” with
each other:

lous.”* .

ect as a rather entertaining comedy. I’m

and I continued to do so. | felt that this
was @ Very amateurish attempt al some-
thing which I didn’t know really what
was going on, and it was an interlude of
entertainment as far as I'm concerned.”
The role he. played is also unclear.
.From the point that CHS entered the sit-
uation in May of 1966. WerBell appeared
at various times to be a network consul-
tant, a CIA operative, a CIA operative
impostor, a leader of the invasion, a U.S.
government spy on the invasion, a gun-

‘runner and a wired-for-sound observer in

an attempt to shake down the Haitian
consul in Miami for $200,000 to call off
the invasion. °
Suffice it to say that the entire episode
was typified by tne fact that the 68-foot
sloop Poor Richard, a beat WerBell had
leased for the expedition, was repossessed
while WerJell and others had it docked
at the Ocean Reef motel in Key Largo.

sons were indicted for conspiring to vio-
late U.S. neutrality laws — including
WerBeil. ‘Charges . against WerBell,

_ however, were dropped on orders of
* then-Attorney . General Ramsey, Clark.

_. WerBell now ‘declines to’ discuss the
mechanics of how the charges against
him were dropped, except lo- say that he
was “in constant contact with the govern-
ment” during his participation in. the in-
vasion altempt and that he “did nothing

* wrong.” In 1970, however, WerBell told

an.Atianta magazine writer, “When you
work for the company, they take care of
you.” _

“The company” is generally used asa

euphemism for the Central Intelligence

Agency — an arm of government WerBell

says now he has never had anything to do
with, except to sell it some guns. The
company he was talking about, he says,
was CBS. Over the years, however, Wer-
Bell has spoken often. of his association
with the Company. Producer McMautlen
quoted WerBell to the congressmen as say-
ing he had * revious experience” with “the

“company.” “And when I asked him what
company he meant, he said the Cla,” Me-

Mullen said.

“Everybody always gets that impression
about any goddam th:ng we do,” WerBell
says. It is a conclusion that is_ neither
difficult nor illogical. It may not, however,
be accurate. ;

his : firm's revolutionary silenced sub-
machine gun to a South Vietnamese gener-
al?

To quéstions such as these, WerBell’s
standard reply is, ““I guess I'm just lucky.”
More than just luck, howevez, WerBell’s
propensity for being in'the crucial place
at the crucial time seems to stem from 8
combination of machismo, the profit mo-
tive, aknack far developing sums otly rad-
ical weaponry and a plug-in tothe Old Boy
Network.

The Old Boy Network — “And don't you
ever kid yourself that there isn’t such @
thing,” says WerBell — is the cloak-and-
dagger types’ answer to the union hiring
halt. It is a loosely structured help want-

- ed-situatiun wanted grapevine. “T became

friends with a bunch of guys who are now
four- and five-star generals,” recalls Wer-
Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind
Japanese fines in World War I. :

Mhemorabitia of the OSS days and sub-
sequent adventures hang in WerBell’s
home and in his psyche. The walla of both
his upstairs den and downstairs “war
room" are decorated with dozens of hunt-
ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)
weapons. Six unsheathed swords are
mounted cn the dvor of the liquor cabinet.
Two glass display cases in the den, each
locked, contain handguns ranging. from
standard .45 automatics to single-shot
assassination pistols. Daggers, bayonets
and throwing knives fill the in-between
spaces as bric-a-brac. Photographs of
short, slant-eyed generals hang on walls
and stand on tables. Between two wild boar
heads above the den entrance is a framed
certificate from the Vietnamese Airbome.

The biggest war souvenir. though, isn't
on WerBell's wail. [t is in his head — the
way a man of 55 acts after more than 20
years of being in and on the fringes of vio-

ient conflicts. Some of it, obviously, is ©

affectation. Some of it is genuine. And
some of it just seems strange to &n outsider

Mirror (circulation five million) that he
was: I) four-square for the cause of the
Council for a Free Abaco, and 2) récruiting
British mercenaries “for a project J have in
mind.” Abaco? “Who said it was Abaco?”
said WerBell. The fruit of the interview

WILLIAM R AMLONG oa Heraid stati writer, -

was a front-page story headlined: “Mutiny
in Paradise . .. The Island That Wants to
Stay British - A Call Goes Out fur Mer-

- Genaries.”

- Such were the initial tactics in the Bat-
tle of Abaco, a cause that, for swhile in the
British press, seemed second in anticipated
ferocity only to the Catholics-vs.-Protes-
tants strife in Northern Ireland. Joining
WerBell as a comrade-in-press release was
Lt.-Col. Colin (Mad Mitch) Mitchell, a
right-wirig House of Commons member
and a hero of the Battle of Aden during his
days with the Argyle & Sutherland
Highlanders. Mitchell, who was muttering
tothe Bnitish press ‘about: secret missions to
Abaco and the such, recently visited Wer-
Bell in Powder Springs, WerBell said.
‘While there are some people who: admire
flamboyance atich as WerBell's, there are

. others wo don't. Among those others are

WerBell’s former business associates, a
group of New York investment bankers
who bought WerBeil and Bennett B.
Bintliff, an associate, out of the Military
Armament Corp. (MAC) that the pair had
founded. “He's been headline press all over
England, ond we're just s quict little man-

Reeves II], chairman of the board of MAC's
parent company, Quar.tum Corp. “He's a

Reeves, however, says he doesn't dislike
WerBell — he just doesn't want to be
associated with him in the arms business.
“like him a great deal. He's amusing and
he's a character. But letting him run Colt
or jetting him run MAC is like turning
loose a high-school hot. todder to: run
General Motors.”

WerBell and his associates in Powder
Springs have now reincorporated under the
name of Defense Systems International
Inc. and have hired away several of MAC's
former weapons specialists. They are not
overly fond of Reeves and his people either.
“Tunnel vision” is one phrase they use to

says WerBell. “We have no intention of

Anyway, they héve more arms down there
than we have here.”

Abaco appears to be composed oft wo mea,

settled Abaco immediately after the Amer-

from the British Crown. He savs he was
referred to WerBell through persons he met.
while organizing a demonstration against
allowing Air Cuba to service the Nassau
airport. “The people met there, basically

Bell.” Hall is secretary of the council.

founded solely for the Abaco venture. Why
it was necessary to establish such a
company is unclear. Of its name, WerBell
says, “I think it’s Greek for war.

f quartor's Traces on the Military Armanent_Corporation.
scewercuai -MHARGS ART OAS Stated in Paragraph Three ,

Reference: Port Louis 12011, 17 May 1973.

... 4. There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. Winkler,
but there are traces on the Military Armament Corporation and its
Eoard Chairman, Mr. Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910)..

In 1967 WerBell organized a firm called SIONICS, Incorporated

(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and -Counter Subversion),
+Specializing in producing silencers. In 1970, Werbell Bakged with .
Quantum, Ordnance Bankers and the new firm was named the Military —
Armament Corporation with werBell-as Chairman of the Board.

.2. -“WerBell- was, born.:on..8 March 1918 in Philadelphia,’ Pennsylvania.

He’ served in: the OSS‘ and-was ‘of interest to BKHERALD in 1959 when it
was discovered-that.he was. involved :with anti«Castro plotters in
‘| the Dominican Republic. <He was granted a POA in August 1959 but this
“was cancelled in. October .1959:-when his information proved to be of
oh. le. value. and it..was ‘suspected that™he was using ‘BKHERALD funds

, to promote personal interests. He has subsequently attempted to

- pass himself as LNBUZZ connected. and as a BKHERALD employee. Mr.
-WerBell's lengthy,.201 file shows a long history of his appearing in
areas’and situations whére he can make a fast buck.. He is character-
ized-as unscrupulous, a "wheeler dealer", and a promotor of grandiose
schemes, WOTACK advises that the arms WerBell offers for sale are

of good quality, but that the selling price is considered excessive.

3. In that Mr. WerBell is a WODUAL citizen, the above infor-
mation should not be. passed to CGPAT/1. -However, the Station could
inform CGPAT/1 that ‘the Military Arriament Corporation has an unsavory
reputation and, although it may have permission from NVIDEA to export
-;-arms; -it~ has” no“ LNBUZZ connections and that any dealings with the
-orporation should be approached with extreme caution.

‘a James WILSON called the CIA Duty Officer of the Donestic |

Contact Service (DCS) office in Hougton,. Texas, and sub-
sequently related a story akout a proposed plot being
__Btaged in the 0.8, to invade Haiti and overthrow the

Duvalier Governrent, and that CES had convinced the parties
involved that -they should allow CBS to photouraph and
televise a Special Program on the preparations. WILSON
requested aad received sasurances from the DCS officer

that he would not be identified as the source of this

.... inforantion.

3. On 6 July 1966, WH Division sent a bling peno~
vandum to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Department of State which forwarded a resume of WILSON's
story to the DCS, without identifying the source. The
memorandum stated that the source's motive for disclosing
this infornotion was to alert the U.8. Covernment to &
