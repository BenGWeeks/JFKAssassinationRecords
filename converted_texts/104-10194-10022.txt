supervisor endorses “Mi. Widalgo's desire td be considered for
transfer to another. component, namely OTR (specifically covert

lecturing and teaching.* Finally, regardicss of the ‘shortcomings
reflected in this evaluation, the grading officer finds much to
admire in Mr. Hidalgo personally. 7 ee .

*should a “suitable. opéning’ in that field be unavailable, it is

felt there would be merit also in consideving Mr. Hidalgo's a

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL :

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo
with Gea exception to the statement that Subject works well
under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under
“ great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even
more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. With —
this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of
Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

which he understands fully and handles well He has had problems with his
health but these largely have been overcome and in the past 9 months have not
