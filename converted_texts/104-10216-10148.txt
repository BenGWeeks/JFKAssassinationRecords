} 3. (BACKGROUND

@peration AXNTRUNK III/IV which was mounted in August 1963 was
Successful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE~27
oo and AMICE-14, were abls to contact aod to recruit two princi.
“" "pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground-
work fo> the MHAPRON objectives of the AMTRUNK Operation. One
of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUNK~9, was oxfiltrated with the
- | Zour-man ANTRUNK infiltration seam for training and operational
. discussions in the JMWAVE area. In early September, AMTRUNK-9
was re-infiltrated into PBRUMEN in Operation ANTRUXK Vv, the
. . Same operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAS ~1, -3, -13 and -34,
“In late October AMICE-27 was separated from the clandestine
wo part of the AMTRUNK operation. The original objectives of
Operation AMTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January
1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two
internal P/A’s toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re=
- eruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the
Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this mission was
altered by the receipt of a commercial telegram in open code
0°. 2rom AMTRUNK-9 indicating that he was in grave danger and wished
< °° t0 bs exfiltrated. The twin Objectives of Operation AMTRUNK VI
. then became: first, to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-9 and, this acconm-
“plished, for AMICE-14 to proceed to Havana for his task of ree
" channelling ANTRUNK-10's responsibilities. ‘The exfiltration of
AKTRUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of
wife, brother-in-law, and three szall children, was accomplished
- on 9 January 1964. The unexpected presence of AMTRUNK-9's
family, couple? with reports of increased vigilance in the infil-
‘tration area, forced AMICE-14 to exfiltrate the same night with-
, out attempting to accomplish the second part of his mission.

The AMTRUNK IC will then proceed to the vicinity of coor-

- Ginates 133511, AMS 4085 ITI. . At this point, AMICE-14 and/or
. AMTRUNK-7 will make contact:with either Oscar DIAZ Jabiela-

. Garcia or his son Antonio DIAZ Torres in Casualidac
(17654795, AUS 4085 III). These two individuals are knowl-
edgable of the fact that the ANTRUNKs may return to the in-
filtration area although they do not know even the approxi-

mate date. Oscar DIAZ and his son Antonio are prepared to _

_ activate the ratline consisting of three different taxis, to Soo,

rig. Gen. Jose SEMIDEY, ex-Comptroller of the National » ~
rmy and veteran of the Spanish-American War. SEMIDEY
studied for one year at Purdue University, Indiana.
He and AMTRUNK-13 graduated from the second class of
ANACRA Pilot Training School in 1942. SEMIDEY flew for
Expreso Aereo Inter-Americano and Cuba Aeropostal for
_ about 11 years before he became Interventor or Adminis-
trator for the latter company after the Revolution. After
Cuba Acropostal was absorbed into Cubana, SEMIDEY held
various positions of importance in Cubana. He also holds .
the rank of Captain in the Rebel Air Force and reportedly -
has made reconnaissance flights and black flights carrying
arms and/or agents to and from other Latin American
countries. SEMIDEY has a close friendship with Victor
.,. PINA Cardoso, the Director of Civil Aviation, and i6 ree
) portedly close to Raul CASTRO for whom he is a frequent ~
personal pilot. Because of the close former friendship
7 between ANTRUNK~13 and SEMIDEY and’ because of reports
sv. + $yom AMICE-14's family which indicate that SEMIDEY has
‘+ peeome disenchanted with the Castro regime, both AMTRUNK~13
