&t appears, has left AMBIDDY-1 with the completely erroneous
impression that wo were taking sides in the factional dispute
favolving AMYUM, in essence backing ANYUM-19 against AMBIDOY-2.
In advising AMBIDDY-1 on the pros and cons of dismissing

GAMBORA (P), AMYUU-19 told AMBIDDY.1 that dismissal would in:

Should he in honest conviction reach the conclusion that he was
shunted aside because. KUBARK ‘considered him an: obstacle to -

a betrayal. Other "ideological" considerations could be adduced
by him to justify actively ‘opposing KUBARK. .Whatever he may

‘de along those lines would not be through inadvertence but by

Gesign. We havewighed and discarded the possibility of

neutralising him through recruitment. This would not work aft

our reading of his personality is correct. We can think of a
number of deterrents, out of KUBARK's reach, which wil) probably
make him think twice before throwing down the gauntlet. To:

" @f defiance of which we consider: AMYUM-19 incapable. Bczides,

decision to accede to ANBIDDY-1's desires on worRing level

1, We advised SAMRORA at a Washington meeting with him,
16 June 1964, that from the way things look to us he had painted
himself into a corner from which he could not extricate hisself.
Another error was to have permitted someone like MOLE to block
his. path to the AMWORLD hierarchy. This in. retrospect, however,
is all water over the dan, : _

2, If SAMBORA is to perfore his functions as we first con
ceived them he should go to AMBIDDY-1 and arrive at a new under
BAMEORA was informed that we intend to meet ANBIDDY-1 before
BAMBORA returne to Miami. At this meeting we intend to state in
no uncertain terms that the security of the organization is in a
deplorable condition. This perhaps may have the effect of placing
SAMBORA in a more favorable bargaining position, *

-- 9, We counseled SAMBORA to negotiate a hard contract which

"would encompass at least the folloving terms:

2 a. He would not work under nor be responsible to MOLE
“but only to the highest echelons of AMWORLD hierarchy.

Leon. The Venezuelans believed they could make a pact with
the Communists and later eliminate them. At that time various
members of FALN came to Miami (source’ doesn't remember when).
AMBIDDY/1 assured the Venezuelans he could influence GPFOCUS
and KUBARK to get support for their cause. -

Carlos SISO told source he distrusted AMBIDDY/1 and
believed he was a KUBARK penetration to learn all their plans. -
SISO also told source that when Osvaldo BAJARES returned to

had denounced BAJARES. In the last meeting, SISO told source
that. he was going to put AMBIDDY/1 toa test. SISO asked him
“whether it was true he had gone to Haiti on an official mission
ag an ODYOKE envoy.” . AMBIDDY/1 was very surprised and said he
had, but insisted in SISO telling him how he had learned that,
The weetings with the groups of Venezuelans stopped since that
time. : . .

_ After these happenings, AMBIDDY/1 informed source he
had written a report to the Americans about the Venezuelan
problem, and that he had treated Rafael CALDERAS very well in
this report because CALDERAS had given him financial assistance.

13. One time AMNBIDDY/1, Iden B and source had a meeting and
discussed who should be che pilot of his private aircraft. Iden
B proposed a pilot named ALEXANDE (according to source, ALEXANDER
had relations with Iden B,) but AMBIDDY/1 opposed this and
complained thrt the PBPRIMERS forced him to select the personnel,

14, About 7 months ago (on or about Nov. 63), AMBIDDY/1 told
Iden B and source that he was going to receive a secret training
course under PBPRIME direction, AMBIDDY/1 used to leave every
day at 6 AM and come back at night. According to source, the
course lasted 6 weeks and most of the times Iden B used to drive
AMBIDDY/1 in an automobile to.a place in Coral Gables where the
course was being given. Every time ANBIDDY/1 returned from the
classes he talked about the things he had learned and talked
about secret writing, codes, of some pens with a substance which
could kill instantaneously, about sabotage methods, etc., etc.

house making up accounts to justify expenses, .

“WE 71st Street, AMBIDDY/1 talks constantly in the house where he
lives with her about his future pl.ns, about the single party,.
about the. dictatorship which has to. be imposed in Cuba, etc.
“ AMBIDDY/1 often puts on a uniform, poses in front of the mirror ar
talks about invasion. , .

: _ WAVE Comment: This is one of several recent reports
concerning statements attributed to AMBIDDY/1 in which he has:
spoken of the need for a strongman to run Cuba. AMSHADY/1 reports
that on 10 June Aurelio MARIN Naredo (one of approximately ‘30
AMWORLDERS recently arrived from the camps) states that AMBIDDY/1
appeared at the training camps, took a dictatorial position on a ~
number of issues terminating with the statements to the effect
‘that he was the only one to liberate Cuba, he was the only one to
run it later, and that there would be no voting and no elections.
MARIN.‘objected, stating that he had joined a revolutionary group,

- not a dictatorship, and along with other trainees requested to

return to the WAVE area. According to AMSHADY/1 when the trainees

arrived and went to the 4MYUM offices to receive their final check

AMJAVA/4 refused, a. fight ensued and AMYUM/19 had’ to intervene.

MARIN characterized AMBIDDY/1 as deceitful, liar, coward, demagogu

dictator, power mad, a flagrant opportunist who cannot be trusted,

etc. Realizing that AMSHADY/1 is strongly prejudiced’ against _

AMBIDDY/1 this comment is forwarded for what it is worth. -AMYUM/1

has corlirmed.the -incident at the AMYUM office’ and states that,.

whether or not it ia justified, there ia a considerable number’ of

BAWORLDERS who hold similar views now and who Attribute statements

_ Iden B and is the one: who really directs her. .

20. Source further reports that the current. AMYUM Chief of
Intelligence, Iden H, is married to a woman named Iden I, who
practices prostitution, AMBIDDY/1 has ordered the Intelligence
Chief to collect information on Iden B, but all the reports he
submits on her are good because the AMYUM Intelligence Chief is.
ar unconditional supporter of Iden B. One time the AMYUM'
Intelligence Chief hit an AMYUM member because he made unfavorable
comments about Iden B..

21. Source learned from Iden B that Juan AMADOR Rodriguez is
one of the newspapermen in exile who receive money from AMBIDDY/1.
Iden B also told source that the articles and declarations nade :
by Iden J are written by Iden K.

Iden B used to “pose” with her sister to please her lover
BATIGTA and her husband. Afterwards, Iden C continued | to explost

relations with Iden A (source #1), In turn, this Iden A also
has homosexual relations with a known homosexual named Iden G,
aka “Campeona", who lives with Iden B and AMBIDDY/1,

According to source, this group of “ladies” used to meet

"parties". One of Iden B's friends is Aida PEREZ Poza, aka "La
Gorda", who together with-Pat (aka "La Americana") are partners
of a man called "Chucho" who is in jail on charges of narcotics
trafficking in which he was recently surprised.

Source states that she is well acquainted with Iden B's
intimate affairs because she knew her in Cuba and lived in her
house here in Miami for one year.

-_-__- Qn 17 May 1964, Francisco TABERNILLA Palmero talked to
AMWORM/2 and told him KUBARK was investigating the private lives
of AMBIDDY/1 and Iden B, because-it seems it is feared AMBIDDY/1
is being infiltrated by "batistiano" elements, . .

1. AMBIDOT/1 himself raised this matter with ne
while neither James nor Ferrer were within carshot.
Queting AMYUM/19, he inquired whether marriage with
Subject would be one of the causes for KUBARK to
terninante the exiating AMFORLD relationship. 1:

_eaphatically answered in the negativa, going over by
mow well-trodden ground once more and, hopefully,
waking myself understood. . 2

.2. In summary, I stated we held no views one way
or the other about hie intent to contract uarriage.

: @uar concern was strictly political since we could.
ve wisualise a number of unpleasant consequences floving |
' -Qvom the event. True or false, certain allogations

. Bad Deen made about Subject's past and thore were a

_ goedly number of people prepared to testify to the .
accuracy of those allegations, among then.(I presumed):
Subject's ex-husband. The political implications of
‘the proposed union could not possibly escape hin, ©.

: eupeciaily. if ANTHUG should get hold of it. :

: 3.. ANBTDUT/1 opined that he had lived in open -
’ gin with Subject for over.a year. This was what was
bothering him and evidently sone of his closest... ..:.
| esgsoctates, not Subject'a alleged past. He needed.
. gags relationahip with dubject to maintain (literal
- quote) his emotiozal balance. He was. der:

_ eonsiderabie strain and the. rare moments with Subject:

Since it was not curiosity that had prompted us to ask
for timely reporting but a desire to be of service in -
protecting the rear, we-were now wondering whether .
at would not be best to leave the determination whether
oF not to subsit political reports ‘to him rather than

that is done blindly is done. badly, it is true that I had con- i

were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where ’

the weapons we used in the invasion ceme from.} I. had no scru-

AQSIOELD MEETING IK WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 Hay 1966

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY'S PERSONNEL POLICY

1. ANJAVA/4 offered the following analysis of
MBIVOT-1's personnel policy as a significant fecre
ef his relationship with others.

2. AMBIDDY-1 is a leader and a very proud leader
who does not like to fail in the presence of his associates.

_ © ¥.. AMJAWA/6 was glad that the Miami incident (13 May
press conference) happened. “AMBIDOY-1 was really anary
with himself.”

ry Pron the atert AUAVA/A ban tried to convince
AMBIDDT-1 thet Jose MOLE ROSALES is no t qualified for
fmtelligence - so far in vain. "To let MOLE fail in.
_ doing the Job is the way to convince AMBIDDT<1”

. 3. AMTIM-19 cannot handle MOLE. or Edgar S0PO,
because AMBIDDT<1 won't let him. (“We shall have to wait
‘ @atil they fall down on the job."

a a MUAVA/4 clains ‘to have a closer relationship.

‘with A@IDUY-] than dove ANTUN-19.. He thinks he ‘undare

etends AMBIDUT-1 berter than does AMTUH-19, that he

eritical perioc following the Miami presse conrerence,

ANTUM-19 was the. only available, cleared channel to i

MGWELD and tine, in view of GIACID's unlavorebls reaction, : ’

was of the essence. AMJAVA/4 wos. asked to convey this . |
- explanation to AMBIDDT-1 and to stress that ws consider

. - ’ Segoe
8. AMJAVA/& stated that there had been aany betrayals — | :
end consequently AMBIDUY-1 was always carefal. at tines —
be might even think that AMYUM-19 was not loyal which,
ANUAVA/4 added, "Of course is not trus." As AMBIDDT-1 ; ,
analyzes. hie ow performance, he is satisfied that he is |
performing well. %s has been in the resistence business : t5
_.eince Batista's days and many intimate friends have be- : 3
trayed him. At the prescat moment, ha doss not ‘have 100%
confidence in anyones. Everything he is told, be analyses.
As an example, AMJAVA/4 briefs Chaves (the Mexican) cn a
projected operation. AMBIDDY-1 will question “AMSAVA/4
closely in order to mske sure that the instructions did
‘pot deviate from the plan as conceived by him. - ae

9. Among matters which should be taken up with
AMBIDDY-1 direct, no matter how ticklish, was.¢.g. the
case of ...HOLE. AMJAVA/4 and AMYUM-19: know. that KUBARK
 tpawe a poor opinion of hin. ‘Then why beat around. the —

UL. BECKHOVY streseed that wo were anxious not to { ,
give AHBIDDY-1 the impression that there exists any. .
epecial relationship between us and AKTUM-19, AMJAVA/4.

Our reletionship was with AMBIDDY-1 who is the leader — .
ef the noveuent. AMJAVA/4. replied that he had told aMBIDOTe1
this and that BECKHOFF had aade this point very clear at
their first meeting in Puerte Rico (see AMIORLD Mooring 4
meno, 3-6 September 1963 Subject: Briefing of AMJAVA/4.) : ;
BECKHOFF added that. he had told AMYUM-19 and wished to .
repeat this in the presence of AMIAVA/4 that anything — .
@iscucsed while. AMBIDDY-1 was not present, could be told : te
hia. Nothing was “off-the-record” in the sense. of to- *
be withheld from AMBIDDY-1. Ss 4

12. According t2 AMJAVA/4, AMBIDDY-1 knows full
well thet KUBASK considers hia the Chief. If we decided
to conspire against AMBIDDY-1 in league with AMIAVA/4
end AMTUMe19, this could only. be done within AMYUM, the
political movement, since AMJAVA/4 and AMYUM~-19 fore pars
of that organization. Our support, however, ie to
@BIDOTe1 and not AMYUM.. AMBIDDY-1 knows that. ©

makes known his decisica to marry Subject. In the saze breath,

‘AMJAVA-4 stated that he bad not made his views knowa to AMBIDDOT-1.

“because then our position vould be the way it ia sow vith:
ANYUM-19. You cannot put AMBIDDY-1 to the wall. He must be

ise working for AMYUM and in that regard is answerable to.
all oc us, because be is part of AMYUM. When we talk
‘about the Adelaida. problem, we talk about a problem |
arising within the organization. AMBIDDY-1 knows that: -
be will have KUBARK's support which ic meant for hin not

- 1, According to ANYUM-19 (DOI 4 May), AMBIDOY-1 once more is
giving serious thought to Contracting marriage with Subject.

2. According to ANYUM-19, AMBIDOY-1 suffers pangs of conscience
and has presonitions of hell. What he has in mind is a church
wedding with all the trismings. Since Subject's previous marriage

was not solemnized by the Chureh, AMBIEOT~1's ‘conscience appears
unbothered.

-3.. AMYUM-19 claims that ANBIDDY~1 brushes off allegations about
BSubject’s ‘alleged affair with Fulgencio Batista as were cal

umny.
He does not know whether AMBIDDY-1 has ever asked Subject te confira
or deny the rumor. —

4. The root of the trouble, as AMYUM-19 sees it, is that AMNBIDOY-1
in the person of Subject is encountering a seasoned pro who plays with
consummate skill upon hie vanity and who exploits hia naivete which
is that of "a 14 year old." AHBIDDY~-1, in fashioning personal relation-
ships; .s unable to make adjustments to the circumstance that, being
@ person of some importatce, his personal affections are not always
cultivated on purely unselfish grounds.

a 6. ANTUN-12 claias that Subject’s former husband, Roger Hermilio
Rojas Lavernib, is attempting to blackmail AMBIDDY-1 and that eome of

AMBIDDY-1's seemingly closest associates. may. be harboring siniler
Gesigas.

6.. BECKHOFF restated the position of KUBARK:as one of. non-inter-
vention as long as matrimony is kept in abeyance. Conversely, marriage
-and any ensuing scandal would. force us to re-assess our position and,
i extremes, night force KUBARK to withdraw ite backing of

ate  ARYUN-19 expressed the view that AMBIDDY-1 would probably
forego marriage if made aware of KUBARK’s position as stated above.

.

1. AMBIDDY-1 was reminded that he should make a quick
., trip to the Dominican Republic to see President Reid and to
"arrange for drydocking and refueling facilities.’ A-1 was’
“advised to use a more subtle approach than used on Colonel
Lopez of Honduras, A-1's main. objective should be. to: get.
-“his foot in the door" in the Dominican Republic... A-1.
‘should pursue. the soft sell. cather than the bard sell.
.| Bimce he sounded a bit reluctant to. forego: ‘the next. operational
“- phase in: order to repair the: ADELAIDA,A-1. was reassured.
that the overhauling of the. ADELAIDA would take place after .
the operation rather than before... A~k will: take. AMJ/.VA-4°.
Swith him to the Dominican. Republic. Should President : Reid.
- ask for the name of the shipping company who will, act:.as—
the agent for Maritima Eam, A-1 should: say it. ‘As the: ‘Boyd
‘Brothera Shipping Compan;.. -

2, A-1 was asked if he had: ‘obtained. his: 0, 8 visa,

4. A-l commented if it would be. possible for: Kelly
to arrange fueling facilities at Bluff with Texaco Oil
vahter than Esso. The person in charge of the Esso company
in Bluff apparently is not in sympathy with MRR. movement;
therefore, A-l is reluctant to deal with ‘Esso, Awl
inquired if the person in charge of Esso could be replaced.
A-1 was informed that although Kelly enjoys a. great deal .
of influence with Esso we doubt that he has that much. ~
influence, As it stands now the LCM obtains supplies there
and it is then tranferred to the ADELAIDA. because A-1 is ~
reluctant to take the ADELAIDA near the Esso installation.

5. In conclusion A-1 was complimented on the manner
his organization behaved during the operation.

_ 6, Should A-1 obtain any definite information as to
when he will be going to the Dominican Republic he should
call our office in order that we may make our own traveling
arrangements.

2. On 4 May 1964 EQS representatives raised with ANYDM-19
the question if AMBIDDY-1 in bis own mind accepts the premise .
ef independence from KUBARK contro) ia his management of aMWORLD

the launching of Operation ZEON, prepared a “three and cae —

' Belf page” news release which laid exaggerated claim to.
dimClicted during the raid on Santa Cruz del Sur.

|
|
Ouily. the last sentence wtated, sore or leas as an afterthought, te

nae

that this should be considered just a minor HAR operatioa. .

AMYUM-19 has told ANBIDDY-1 that in his opinion any suture

— te should be held. down to one or two brief. para-
° . . . . oo

2. We pointed out to ANTUN-19 that AMBIDDI-} was.
_@vidently paying no more than lip service to our
* dation that he under-—rather than over--play his successes.
fering the Washington meeting (19-21 March 1964) we had.
. eriticized a statenent made by AMSIDDY-1 during a Miami press
. eeaference to wit: “He do not bave exough boats. In one

aight we can make two trips but not more, but we are doing
-4¢. We will £211 the country with enough arms to free the
 exuntry. from communian." Ve. took the position that if ve were
_ $m AMBIDDY-1's shoes: ve simply wouldn't ‘let on about ailitary:..
_ . gutters since this pigys inte Castro's hands, giving his.
uo gratuitous access to military inteiiigesss.. AXMBIDDY-1
_ eountered by asking. us how-he could raise the moralc of the
-" people without saying anything end without talking about .
- gaecessful ops inside. . oe
7 Se, We mentioned. to AMBIDDY-1 that any vital inforsa-
~ ‘tem aot publicized sakes the task of Castro's espionage
_gervies that more difficult. Besides, things had now. come.
.. > @ pass where little credence was placed in Glains. of.
- gucoess and preaises besd cut by Cuban exile leaders. That
 @aaliy counted was the denonstrable substance of cuccess

later. This approach rather than the clain of a big victory

Be
would arvuse the kiod of interest, and in Castru’o case, the

kind of premonition vhich carries psychological impact.

4. We doubt whether AMBIDDT-1 at this stage is prepared
ye heed cur counsel to be oonvervative in his claims to victory.
In the unhealthy clisate of. conpetition, engendered by the.
epectacie of sumerous exile organizations vying to be the first,

1. Attached are two recent reports covering the activities .

of Jose Elias aka Nacin. The Habana contact, Sernardo Nievares

has informed AMYUY thut if he can be picked up he will be able

‘-@0 come to the WAVE area for about 1S days for debriefing end —

’ training. The Ramon Mondeizr Cid, aka “el diablo" mentioned as

having been released by the G-2 and waiting for exfiltration iso

currently in the WAVE area, having escaped with four others.

, Accordir.g to A-19 they have been interviewed by SDURGE and were

told to have no contact with any othér PBRUMEN groups because

they could receive special training and be sent back to work

against ANTHUG, The AMYUF: have been debriefing the five for

several days with the sam idea in mind. GUERTLER will get:the.

reports when the debriefings are over. A-19 ‘has not gotten the

: pre. reports but says Alonso is im,-essed with Mondejar.

As for the exfiltration of Nievares AMYUM has no intention of

attempting it but A-19 is considering offering: the opportunity

to do eo to Aldo Vera (see below). oot tt . :

Aldo VERA Serafin (201-326635) Thies subject is a forser member

of the DTZ, recently considered for use ir an attempt to ‘defec’:

‘Ae19's. evaluation of the man. However,, local traces do contain z

unsubstantiated accutations that he is a G-2 ani that he maintains =;

“the case of Silas COMAS Castro, caytain of a JURE beet rencrtes

to be in trouble after having received a letter fros AMSISDY-2
thanking hia for signing up for AMAORLD. A-19 saic that he woulé
check, but as far as he knew the man must have filled out a fern,
and that it was not a frameup. .

ee 9. Ramon MONDEJAR Cid and the other sembers of the 4.I.D. recently
Ty arrived from Habana have. been completely debriefed by the AMYUM :
- dntelligence section. Very little wss revealed by then during
their processing at the Refugee Center, dit they have been |
very. cooperative with the AMYUMS. They have been kept isolated
from the rest of the: PBRUMEN. community with the intention of.
. training them and sending. them back. A-19 would like to use
- Aldo VERA Serafin's group to reinfiltrate this group and pick up
the Habana coordinator,’ Sdrnardo, NIBVARZS, Now that Nacin is not
- available, having been kicked out of YOACRE (at KUBARK request,
according to A-19) the AMYUMS have no way to contact, NIEVARES.
A-19 mentioned, using his embassy contacts to do this, but the .
writer strongly urged him to keep this growp compietely compartuented
from any other groups. So far MONDEJAR has .made a very: favorable - :
impression on his inters: .crs but very little. is known about the
coordinator, Benny NIEVARE!. Guertler suggested that A-19 should
Rave these people questioned apout wh * they “now of NIEVARES,
the circumstances. surrounding their reccuitment. This group was

1315 hours

“<3. The following was relayed to AMBIDDY-1: "We are -
glad you have second thoughts about Playa Giron. We have
received more information about military, erpecially maritime,
build-up in that sector which would make any landing attempt i
virtually suicidal." AMBIDDY-1 stated he would confer with :
AMJAVA<4 and AMYUM-19-and give us his final. decision as:.to i
. whether or not this operation would be run. : AMBIDDY-1 commented i
that one life meant more to him than the entire operation. How :
-ever; A=l again reminded this office of the: impact anattack on
on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale H
of the Cuban people. The undersigned replied that.there are :
two sides to the coin; should their operation fail, this would
play into the hands of Castro, and: it was: the opinion of ‘this ..
office that the alternate plan would also domuch to raise the |
of the Cuban people. . . ae mies

« In conclusion it was reaffirmed to: A=1 that the : og
inal decision is his. He replied that after his meeting:;. =

THIS 1S UNEVALUATED INPORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT 1S TENTATIVE.

source. A Cuban exile observer who was present during the speech. o

_ Headquarters Comment. The following is a résumé of the political
Philosophy of Wanuel Artime Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary
Recovory) aS prepared by Source, It is based on statements
made by Artime in his speech on 18 March 1964 to the Associacién
para Recuperacién Econémica de Cuba (AREC, Association for
Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled
Comunismo por qué? (Communism <or what?), which was written
nine months beiore Castro came to power, and on Artime's book
Traicién (Betrayal).

}

1. Artime does rot believe in political extremes —~ neither the
: left nor the right. He believes that extremes always end by
touching one another. If any extreme gains power in Cuba,
and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship,
a he will continue to fight with weapons in hand. Artime does
‘ mot believe in the classification of men by rece, by political
ranks in former governments, or by money.. He confesses to. being
an opportunist in the sense that he is taking maximum advantage . :
of each opportunity, but not in the sense of changing his a a
beliefs in acnord with opportunities. | ’

- 2, The main theme of Comunismo por qué? was that more than a change
. in government a chenge in the conscience of men is needed, It

outlined the duties of the padr6n (landowner) toward the workers |
BSo that the latter may live in dignity and honor, The padron
Should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems.
The worker, in turn, has certain obligations to the padron, If
this puss pro quo is not adhered to, a (Christian) government

has the rig a intervene for the common good. [In his letter

of resignation ts Fidel Castre accusing the latter of being a

Communist and. trottor, Artime mentioned tnat he resigsed
because Castro had not been honest with the businesszen by
nat tebling thea their property would be conf isca:ied. .

3. The following excerpts from Artine’s book Traicion clearly . | \
--gutline Artine'’s tdeology: : ‘ .

j : a. “We believe the-state should foment and stinulate private
Q. econopy, both national and foreign. — We have to have an

effective democracy in Latin America because the word,
a ' democracy tn that area has been prostituted too often.
i Many countries cali themselves democratic but in reality
H are nothing but militarist and demagogic, and many Sixply
{ go through the. motions of elections. Many are simply - ‘
H totalitarian governments which are living off the blood
i and toil of the people. The corrupt politicians, the
| strong men, the totalitarians have been the strongest
{ allies of Communism. Our. fight is not against one man, a!
| it is not a war of personal hatred--it is a war against i
t . the doctrine of hatred,. be. it called Castro or what have — :
| you--it is a war against a doctrine; ‘re are as much opposed. H

_ =

to Khrushchev as we are against Tito. We are as much opposed a on
to the totalitarian left as we are opposed to the fascist rights. 5

b. "We don't care if they call us extremist. They will con-
tinue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philocom- t
munist, I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was :
passing on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho said Li:
to Don Quixote, ‘Sir, the dogs are barking at us,’ Don a
Quixote replied, ‘Let them, Sancho, if they are barking fee
it ‘is because we are moving. And we will continue to move.'” :

a

c. "They say we are very ambitious. Our ambition is that ‘in a
. the coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pro- Hu
- ,Bounce our name with respect in our country." — . ; f

f
i
|
|

d.- "Our men in Cuba are not only fighting for the independence
_ of our country but also for the independence of the American
“hemisphere, for the survival of Christian principles in

: America, for the Western world." Artime maintains that...
thé situation today is much the way Lenin would have hoped
for.:. Britdin.and France have recognized Red China; the :
U.S. 18 at odds with these two governments--this is exactly ;
what Lenin would have wanted, Artine has supported his i
‘statements, by quoting Lenin, "Within 30 years we will en- -
bark on.a peace oztansive, of coexistence, and we will i
split the free nations and smash the impotent bourgeois." . Hy

"The battie-grounc xor Latin America’ lies 20. miles from.
‘our shores, Should the Western world iose this battie,
‘the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the
side of the Communist camp. Then it would be preferable
to be dead because the free world: will -have coased to be.”

“We are-all guilty for having turned aver. Cube. to the hands
of men who could not govern her properly. . We have: knocked"
on doors and will continue to do so because our cause is
honorable, We cannot afford. to wait for miraciles,:...49

suet prepare fer a long fight and not expect tho aid of _
gush organizations: as -the-OAS and the AUN, | It. is-up to th
Cubans to liberate Cuba, If we ere not going to wage a”
war of principles, I wili not join that atruggle.” -

ACTION RE‘QUIRED:

1 2 UCTION: In the period 6 to 18 January 1964,

AMBIDDY-1l was given hours of tutorial training, .in JMWAVE safe~-

_ iouse facilities, on existing operational doctrine and management
techniques applicable to a major clandestine effort against. PBRUMEN.
A copy of the training schedule which was used in this tutorial

training is attached. At the completion of the training course,

the various training. instructcrs submitted an evaluation on

; AMBIDDY-1, These evaluations are outlined in the following .

“Paragraph. . :

2. EVALUATIONS: The below-listed evaluations were prepared |
by the instructors who participated primarily in Phase I of° —
AMBIDDY-1's tutorial training. The Phase I instruction concentrated
“on: ‘imparting. to AMBIDDY-1 current operational doctrine relative to
unconventional warfare techniques. -The evaluations are as follows:

responded most. enthus cally aspects of the training on

; amall unit techniques. He made detailed notes on the material -
.coversd, and these notes included copies of treining charts and —
‘Giagrdéms. ALBIDDY-1 displayed particularly intensive interest in .
that portion of the training dealing: with the principles: of . .
survival and the issuance of individual equipment... In.the course
of the training, AMBIDDY-] was given several practical tactical
- ‘problems to solve. AMBIDDY-1's solutions to these problems were
logical and reflected.a grasp of the techniques to Which he had.
been exposed during the training sessions. Thomas L. DARGUZIS was
the primary instructor in this phase of the training, and he assessed
AMBIDDY-1 as being an intelligent, alert, highly-motivated
individual who has a realistic appraisal of his own limitations.
and capabilities. :

organization of a basic net, communications and reporting techniques.
In the course of this training, AMBIDDY-1 expressed a particular
interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartnentation.
Charles F. MASENGILL was the pricary instructor for this bloc of
traning,’ and he reports that AXEIDDY-1 was a keen student who
appreciated the opportunity to learn as much as possible about
clandestine operations. MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-1 at the
completion of his training was probably weakest on the topic of

how to report intelligence information. . :

: c. Resistance Activity and Guerrilla Warfare: .AMBIDDY-1
received training on e principles and concepts erent in »
.. Organizing an infiltration team. In addition, he was trained. © ..-4
“ velative to the principles of organizing a resistance net.

Additionally, he was trained in caching, demolition and sabotage’
techniques. AMBIDDY-1 also. received instruction in the principles: -—
and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-l was also given an .
opportunity to familiarize himself, through actual range firing,
with those weapons which are normally used by anti-AMTHUG-1 forces.
-Alton T, PIRNACK was the principal instructor for this bloc of -
training. PIRNACK reports that AMBIDDY-1 was responsive to the -
subject material which was presented to him. AMBIDDY-1 did not
hesitate to ask questions. nor to seek clarification of points which
he did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-1 did indicate that he was
@ neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he |
was most appreciative of the training which he was receiving on

‘these subjects. It was evident during this bloc of training that

. “gaching: was an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for

“: 9. - COMMENT: . Phase II of AMBIDDY-l's training concentrated
‘on exposing ANBIDDY-1 to those management techniques and principles
‘which are applicable to a aajor clandestine operation against a

target like PBRUMEN. This part of the training was carried out.

exclusively by Andrew K, REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZAMKA.. In this
|< phase of the training, AMBIDDY-1 constantly expressed a great deal
of enthusiasm for the subject material which was being presented.
|. Whroughout the training, AMBIDDY-1 gave every indication that he

' wiis absorbing the majc” portion of the training. At the same -
‘time,=it was clear thst he was.overwhelmed by. the material and the
implications of what this training meant. in. terms of:.his conduct in
future operations. After the management phase of AMBIDDY-1's-
training was completed, REUTEMAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83° hours:
training program in its totality with AMBIDDY-1. . In addition, the

1 was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated
in the:.training. As a result. of this review, a consensus was
tyeached that; while AMBIDDY-1 ‘is an intelligent anc responsive. .

student, the training which he received does not qualify him for
the position of senior officer in a. major cla:destine undertaking
against PBRUMEN, ‘The training did, however, alert. sMBIDDY-1 to a
number of problems and pitfalls which he should avoid in his.
activities.:: This training also provided certain guide posts for .
AMBIDDY-1, but these guide posts were laid out in such a concentrated
dose that they cannot be considered as an adequate substitute
for experience or training. in depth over an extended. period. of

° SYNOPSIS OF AMBIDDY-1'S SPEECH TO AREC

nei

18 March 1964 . = , °.

“you will forgive me if before a gathering the Agrupacion de : ,

la Reconstruccion Economical Gy Cuba I do make profound economic

or technical analysis of the reconstruction of Cuba, the reason

is very simple, it is because I don't know. Inasmuch as Ido not... «

like to talk. about things whitch I know nothing. of I prefer not to
_touch upon the- svaject. Here at this gathering: there. are men more

‘eapable than I... . mén who. will have the difficult task of the

reconstruction of Cuba upon their shoulders.
c ‘Yowant to talk about what I know about, But first let me ;

present my credentials. Why the presentation of credentials? When
two. peeple speak for the first time the first portion its the
presentation and this is the first time I talk with. AREC, although
I. have the pleasure of. speaking to some of its. nenbers. separately |
4n great lengths. Why this presentation of credentials?

_ It know our movement. is very controvor#al. “They say we are

of the: extreme right, they say ve are of. the extreme lett. they say

we are. opportunist and they say we are. anbitiaus, I do not expect

‘to change anyone's mind by this talk. I believe: it ie ny duty to

we are prepared to give our %ives and in some cases already have, i

I believe it is our duty to mention then here or anywhere else, .. %
“Parst of all I do not believe in extremes’, . , neither left /“
nor right. I believe extremes ‘always end by touching one another,
/ Secondly - I. want to state that if any extreme’ comes. to power in:

. Cuba, in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship; : :
in both cases we shall continue to fight with our weapons in hand,
Thirdly, I do not believe in the classification of men by

race, political levels in the government. to which they formerly
belonged nor ‘by money . .-. 1 know whites who souls are black and r

AMBIDDY-1 goes on to mention his various publications. He
describes his first publication, *Communisn por que?" (Communism :

what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to
power, The main theme of this pamphlet, according to a1, was
that more than changing a government what is needed is.a change ia.

men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duties of the ~
padron (land owner) te the workers so that the latter may lives

&
#
| : in dignity and sa honor, The satron should feel that the problexs

of his workers are also his problems. The worker. in x turn has”
“‘eertain obligations to the patron, If this quid pro quo is not
adhered to the (Christian) government has the right to intervene

for the ‘common good,

, ‘Later on, after Castro was in pover, Ad wrote his letter of

5 ‘resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor,

In. this letter A-1 mentions he resigned because Castro had not been
honest with the businessmen by net telling. then their property
would be confiscated,

‘bel then went into exile and there he published a book called
Traicoion (Betrayal). Tais book clearly outlined the © sdoflicgxy of

onseience ‘the possibility that the U. S. Government is using; you —

homeland with other activities so that they cannot liberate . their

country. with the force and enthusiasn they desire. ‘The question is
have you considered the possibility that you, ‘under: “your best . ;
Antentions, are the instrument by which these ultra liberal, tovecs
in-the U, 8, can paralyze the liberating activity of ‘the: caben. ‘people?
