“ 5-50

2, Joseph{ MEROLA, 2018 North Bay Road, Miami Beach, Florida,
has advised fepresentatives of another office of this Agency that he
learned from contacts in ‘New York that (fav) PECAR,. a@ Yugoslav trade
official in the U. S,, is being recalled to Yugoslavia and wishes to
remain in theU. S, According to MERALA PECAR will visit Miami from
12 to 19 April 1963. ;

: 3. While MEROLA has an unsavory backeround, the representative
who spoke with him is inclined to believe that he was telling the ©
truth in this instance, MBROLA claimed that he has also informed the
U. S, District Attorney of the above development.

h, It seems probable that (fnu) PECAR is identical with the
subject of referenced memorandum, who was assigned to New York in late
1962 as in INTERTRADE representative.

your Bureau concerning PECAR's alleged desire to remain in the U, 8S,
