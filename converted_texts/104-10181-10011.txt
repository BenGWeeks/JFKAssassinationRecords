round face, fair complexion, blond slightly
wavy hair, light-colored eyes (also reported.
as blue and grecn), wears glasses. No -
visible identifying marks. Well dressed.

Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ

suns up his personality - "a man of many

moods. He has variously been described

as intelligent; ‘mentally alert, competent,
hardwerking, and respected by his subordinates.
Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered,

brusque but-sincere, opinionated, strong-minded ~~

idealistic, self-confident. Has basic
emotional instability, gives impression

of being insecure in his position.. At times
Sarcastic, indifferent, egotistical, cynical,
serious, ungrateful and cold, who,
paradoxically, appears friendly to some people.
Outspoken, compulsive talker, articulate,
‘limited. vocabulary, swears a good deal.

his thoughts about Cuba, a general recommendation can. Yo

be reached.

' 8B. “During the lunch I vas sble to vork the
conversation around to the business potential for
Spanish and U.8. companies in Latin America. Rventu-
ally, we touched on Cuba, and Gervaa said that Subject
considers hisself to be an expert in this area ag he
visited Cuba last year and had a private three-hour
interview vith Fidel Castro. Gervas said that _
Subject received a “snow jod” fron the * jefe", and
thin about sets the tone for his feelings for. the
present Cuban regime. It was not clear hoy Subject
received an invitation to Cuba, but he said that
he aasiated in obtaining a contract from Cuba for
the Pegaso truck compiny - shother as a repre-
sentative of this company or in a free~lance capacity

was not brought out. It Svemed to mo that Subject
is riding an ecotional high for Cuba and Cistro.
His face ‘lit’ up and he becazo relatively oxcited
vhon telling us how Castro mixes and talas with
tho “Common people,” and ia from Spanish parents,
.and-has done ao much for the country. I asked hin
what his goneral inpression vas of life there and
/he replied pnenomenal,” and I believe he seant it.

: C. “‘Somo cozments that Subjoct made vould appear
to be inspired by Cuban Propaganda or a briofing. He
Saiduthat. JKLANCE 18 in-control of U.S, internal
“... Security and im forciag-a rightest swing io ite fa~
ternal politics. Also, all people going to Ciba
we ‘fFom Mexico aro ‘photographed by JKLANCE people, whi)
: Af you" go. from Spain you don't rum this risk, .

ca 1 ‘ m 4f there was good potential: for
“" “S3paaish companies ¢ sing busiticess with Cuba. He replied
that Cuba ‘is: a bridge: to Latin. America, Thia -seened
a strangé ansver, and I pointed: out that you didn't
“have to. go-to ¢ © get to Latin Anerica, He said, ~
th 8: true, her countries will change to the
-Gubaa ‘system aad. wiil héed technicians to assist them. .
Then we (Iguess he seant Spanich buniness weno doing
business with Cuba) ‘will have excellent possibilities.

D.

B. ."Subject said “that -he knew the Cuban Anbassador
to Spain and. in fact visited him this morning and re-
ceived a large box of Havana cigars from hin,

. ¥, “Subject 16 about 30 yearn old, good looking
and cakes an exce@llent first impression, He appeara
to have a good business background in addition to being
4 trained lavyer, Ho seens uggregsive, determined and
has a good imagination for business ventures,

G, "It would be premature to say that Subject leans

toward Comuunism.or has been had by the Cuban I.s. J _
-doubt that be would have talied so freely about his
admiration for Cuba if he is working covortly for then.
It is quite certain that he is being used by the Cuban
Eubassy for cormercial purposes, and I would estimate
that he would eake an excellent “froat man” tor Cuban
business ventures. . : me

“Be "I would recoazend against. trying to recruit
Subject as a means of getting to the Cuban Ambassador, .
He would probably turn down tho pitch and ioforn the
Cuban Eabassay." oo i :

. 2, -The obove report isan exce!lent beginning in cur assess-
_ Beat of Subject and HARRIOTT must be commended tor his adeptness
at steering the conversation toward the relevant areas of interest.
‘Ba think the report stands alone and requires little commentary by
the Station; however, we night add here that there is a atrong
probability that Subject vas indeed ‘BNOwsd vader by the impact? of
his alloged. three-hour “talk with “Castro, Given Castro's charjara
and persuasive qualities it woul not be difficult to “convinces”

a young lawyer, alien to the Cuban environzent, of the progress in
Cuba, Rot. withstanding HARRIOTT's fine report we feel that Subject
ts still wallowing to the ebullience of this confrontation wtth .
Fidel Castro. His short relationship with the Cuban Fabassy and
one visit to Cuba vould hardly make nin an. authority on Cuba.

a ‘There is little ‘we can contribute to the exceptionally’
“fine reports submittéd by Headquarters on AMAUTO-1. His. -

“cehardeter,, personality, ‘physical“and mental: “capabilities,
and to somé extent even his vulnerabilities, are succinctly.
outlined: in: your reports. In addition, you have appropriately
recognized the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his, strong-
mindedness and idealistic character,

2. After a series of discussions among the officers
involved with PBRUMEN operations at. the Station, we have
concluded that to execute a logically developed "traditional"
recruitment, we are faced with the challenge to recruit a
person, an intermediary, in whom AMAUTO-1 has confidence and
respect; an individual who iS able to plausibly carry on a
polemic argument with AMAUTO-1 without cither antagonizing
him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary? s
true role, Moreover, the intermediary must be intelligent
to be able to respond in an appropriate way to our instructions,
as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate. Frankly,
we have no such person, currently on our list of assets and
to find someone with the attributes set forth in Reference aA,
will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to !

work diligently on this problem, :

| CONTINUATION OF
- GISFAICH- | 8] EC RE T/R YBAT

3.. AMAUTO-1 confides in few people. From our reading

ef QUTINID and QUDOZE; there are at least three persons

* who could Josicaldy and effectively fill the role as an
intermediary. They are Identities A, B, and C. We can
categorically eliminate Identity A for obvious reasons, i.e.,
lack of direct access to him. Because of his relationship
to Identit: we can also tentatively climinate Identity B.
He: presents a which” we are not certain should be taken;
however, :we would like “to add a comment on him in a later
paragraph, - Identity C. would seem to be the most logical

young and. one. With whom AMAUTO-1 frequently talks and whom
he often-see We know little about his political proclivities
‘although. ‘ne & S$ the impression of being a moderate analyst
of world events and: doesn't: secin to have a Strong affection |
or aversion for the -PBRUMEN Government. We have.a good
background on hin prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;
however, aS-you:can well, imagine, the report concentrates on

*, the. economic Side of ithe individual.. We have made a number
of- ‘attempts here in the .Embassy to determine whether he has
any American contacts, but with negative results. His visa
‘file does not show where he visited in the United States or
the purpose, except that it was a business trip. He has an

_ indefinite visa and we are fairly certain that, if necessary,
we could use the question of -his visa as an entre to him,

We are currently reviewing with all Station assets their
knowledge of Identity C. In addition, we are also considering
assets such"as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some
‘legitimate buSiness pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective
is to.develop -a warm entree to Identity C without compromising
any of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of
Identity C by either a Station Officer or an asset working
under an officer's instructions. We will keep you advised of
our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate
cover. <A POA on Identity C was requested separately. There
are no derogatory Station traces.

4. Identity B would be an excellent choice if not for
his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be explored
with QUSEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint
operation. QUSEQUIN-48 could probably get the necessary
clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's
aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until
we receive your comments.

5. It'is not too early to consider the emoluments we
might want to offer to AMAUTO-1 at the time a pitch is made.
As always they’ should be divided into two areas - for defection
and for recruitment and work in place.

_  ythe possibility of getting access to the building during the-
‘| . “construction phase ‘to possibly install various audio devices.

j We believe this operation to be a formidable one and we might

forees overseeing the construction, the presence of PBRUMEN .
electricians and other professions, Complicating the access !
to the building. Wo believe AMAUTO-1 has the Bomanian,. |

3. We would be grateful for any information addressees
‘aight have on the. general modus operandi of PBRUMEN security
forces in areas where PBRUKEN official installations have been H
constructed. Have they used PBRUHEN technicians, electricians, to
construction engineers, etc? Also we. would like to know whether i
the PBRUNENS have installed their own telephone system or have
they generally relied on the system of the host country, We
would appreciate too, any comments Headquarters or .

. EDUCATION : Aside from the statistics course’
taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the eyes
of some cbservers,.a solid, formal education,
‘But he makes up for it by being an avid reader _ .
(five newspapers a day, plus books). This impression, .
“however, may be wrong, for there ‘are indications - fe

‘Sensitive to art, or so he says, he

low, cussing quite often in the présence of .

RUIZ is well-versed in world affairs, .
and does have an understanding of international -
trade, co, ;

He has read some of the works of José Martf,
-whom"he likes to quote. But there is another :
book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PRILBY's
the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6,

publications, .

HEALTH : Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very

handsome," according to Anita, the young maid )»,

RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed

“‘bilidis, Late in 1969 he was. planning to go'to .

- Portugal on vacdtion following the advice of his
physician, Dr. Pedro CABAS ( telephones, 276-7746,

But perhaps the most serious censure of
his activities came in by telex (" Why worry?

_ questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade
negotiations with the Spanish Government, [The
trade agreement was extended by mutual consent
to 31 December 1972,

_: In his reply addressed to Radl LEON Torras,

_ first vicé-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban
“official directly responsible for the talks,
Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"
and "consulted" in rather strong language.
Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521

- was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade-
official who had been the source of the complaint.

In the last paragraph he told Rail LEON
that the indemnification question ( payment to
Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba)
depended on ‘his reply to Den Pedro SALVADOR,

a Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on -

of himself, Nevertheless, he has told:close -

friends that he feels very loriely in Spain —

‘and“Has had the désire to simply ‘board a plane -
“return: to. Cuba‘ abandoning the Embassy.

Late in January 1970 he. was again de-

pressed, for he felt like an "exile" ia

Spain after two years of service ( " Even
thotigh ‘LEON played a part ‘in my appointment
I cannot work ‘for a man that I do not under-
stand, Maybe. he sent me abroad to get me out
of the way. I feel as if I were in Miami,")

Re ‘thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and
when he returns to the Island he will definitely
not go back: to MINREX, but to MININT. He has
told close friends his term in Spain is up and
he will be returning to Cuba probably in the

‘summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in

Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife,
has stressed that they are ‘leaving Madrid permanently
in July 1970.

But the most importent revelation of
his views came to light on 11 December 1969,

‘official from Havana: " If I. disagree with
orders, I question them because I am not a
robot nor do I have the mentality of one, As
‘a human being I express opinions no matter

Obviously, a man who thinks in this way
cannot be a Marxist,

Havana because of incompetence, lack of vision,

. to ‘point out other deficiencies in life there,

-a) His recall to- cuba. . | oa

by. ‘The 1O-mil1ion’ ton sugar harvest, which ~
_ is scheduled to end on 15 July 1970. -

RUIZ has indicated that he is. unhappy in - -

- his post--perhaps not really meaning what he:

says--, which he has occupied for over two
years, . :

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans
a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,
he himself may be one of the targets, Assuming
that his ideological inconsistencies have been
noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof
regarding his loyalty. and considering whatever
support he has in Havana, may request his
recall’ at an appropriate opportunity: during
a major reorganization of the Cuban Government,

In any event, RUIZ does not expect to
remain in Madrid much longer, and is planning
to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

Te Cuba is successful in harvesting 10

million tons of sugar, and they have already

reached six, the "victory" chat Cuban propagandists
impact: on RUIZ's thought. He will be less

inclined to defect, in place or otherwise, at
such time,

us to ‘buy, We-also discussed this with Fermin GUTIERREZ,

who visited the Commercial Office and to whom we pointed

out that in view.of the system of payment here in Spain

it was better to purchase a building, since this transaction
at no. time would affect our system in our trade policy with

the project and that he would look at it. The system of. -
payments in Spain allows us to pay $100,000 or $150,000

annually which will not be difficult for us.

"NEIRA, I want . you to talk to CHAIN, not bearing
pressure on hin, but to make. him understand that what
I want.is to leave my successor established, for any
- construction not lasting over nine months I certainly will

not be able to enjoy.

: "another thing I want to bring to your attention 1s
in regard to our Consulate, its activities and relations
with the Visa Section. A letter has come from VERA
addreased to FRANCO pointing to FRANCO's incorrect wording
of a cable to that Section, I agree that it was incorrect,
put I find it strange, that that Section should pay so much
Lo oe To . attention to correct forms and analyze the contents so
‘ a Sg AR little, The contentsof things are not being studied,
. me - : -and it is essential that deep thought be given to the work
i to : a that is being done. When someone comes to the Consulate
with an authorization to travel to Cuba, it is usually
. three or four days prior to flight departure. Since the
Visa ‘Section must defer to the Department, of Emigration
“por its: authorization, inasmuch as the latter determines
whether or not a foreigner can go into Cuba, the process
:is not carried out with the urgency that it requires,
. “eonsequently, there is delay. This creates mich inconvenience
- for us, and even personal problems, for we must consider that
often people arrive with the exact amount of money and & .
week's delay could hurt them so that at times they don't
even have enough money. for lodging or food.

Chilean Communist Party and OSPAAAL whose passage has
been set aside. by. these organizations to travel from

BENAVENTE and his wife, the leading lady in his Peruvian

company which has brought to the stage "Luz de Europa”, If

- . ' theyrare not communists in the sense of the word, e

‘-the reat of the company, they do sympathize with us. They
“anvited.PINEDA to attend the premiere, and he answered
with a cable which was shameful to see and read. The
wording of that cable gives the impression that PINEDA is
being held captive and asks them to please come to his
help and send for him. He makes us look ridiculous. Just
‘think that cable has been read by others before they showed
4t to me. The political position of PINEVA and other Cuban
writers should be investigated, as now they are putting
‘up.on stage "La Noche de los Asesinos" and they also want
another -Cuban ) writer to come, 1 should like to gét your
advice in this area as.I am totally tgnorant of matters
related to culture, for we lave no cultural attaché here,

"there ts alo the following problem: ‘The comrades

. to contact ‘ships on the high seas. In this regard I spoke

'-to MrP.ASENJO-in the Security Department who said there
was no inconvenience on his part if they requested 1t and
took the necessary steps. You know Mr. ASENJO. I saw.
him a month ago and he had asked me if we had decided not
to go ahead with it, as there had not been an answer in

“less Gestrable). In line with these purposes, we offer the follow-
ing readings, which may or may not be entirely applicable to

AMAUTO-1;

a. AWAUTO-1 is a shrewd, articulate person who has
reached heights that probably he might not have reached
under normal circumstances, His work in Spain has been
effective in general, and he seems to be very confideaot
of himself and of the backing which he ‘thinks he has from

DISPATCH :
: b. “Ievertheless, he hag received some rather telling
criticisa of a professional nature, even though it ts
‘unkoown whether this criticism also touches on his personal
life. ‘Perhaps because of this, AMAUTO-1 seems to be very
. careful in whatever he does, avoiding mistakes that would eno-
danger his position, and avoiding any real or fancied
Provocation. - .

.c. There seems to be little question that AMAUTO-1 te
‘approachable, although he would probably resist any
‘Ladirect approach in which “cards are not laid on the table."
‘y: it. appears very. likely that his character is basically incom-
‘patible. . the - system he serves (with ‘profound misgivings
as to its ficiency). :

em» "The. very fact. that he has made « open remarks suggesting
his ‘jabhppinéss sith PBRUMEN and his noo-Marxist leanings in
-an office. he hinself points out. is’ “bugged -by the other side”
ould ‘be- | doterpr ted asa signal from him, indicating that he
. ' His remarks on the subject might be those
he can "Jump. off" at any time, if
: “that he tends to live with criticism ‘from
: . office rather than: try to get out from under ---
perhaps meaning’ that he would not accept a PCS assigoment
"home. (The attachment hereto shows him. describing a
- compatriot who wishes to return home as "a fool.") He has
said himself that he believes AMTHUG-1 plans a major purge —
for mid-1970, and “he. might consider himself as a victim of ©

that purge.”

e. A fact ‘which might affect timing is the arrival of
a child in May. If he were to persuade his wife (and his
governsent)- to have the child in Spain, rather than return
home for it, he would have a good excuse for requesting the
presence of his oldest child (the only one who is now at
_ home). If his wife returnshome for delivery, he would (for
: a time at least) have three hostages in PBRUMEN fastead

of one.

£. UFGA-19006 reported a 1964 attempt to get at AMAUTO-1]
through his wife's relatives. The consensus at the time was
that AHAUTO-1 is prcbably immine to this type of approach.
Headquarters, therefore, still opts for a logically developed,
"traditional" recruitment build-up.

3. %In line with the above, Headquarters suggests to Madrid
certain lines of action which might be followed in an atteppt to

know more about AHAUTO-1. These actions might seem somewhot easier
_| 4° from our perspective than’ they.actually are inthe field, but we
propose them for your consideration. -— - .

a. The man handling the new construction work (paragraph 16
of the attachment) should be checked out.

- Bb. Tho established pattern of lonely automobile trips
outside the capital: (see paragraph 22 of the attachment)
might be instructive to follow down. At least, the situation
might offer a chance for approach or for subsequext handling.

c. AHAUTO-1's desire to see more people at home, and
the indication that he digcusses important matters at hone
becomes doubly interesting with the possibility of a vacant

7 4 house next door (see paragraph 18 of the attachment). The
‘person who owns the partment building migit offer a fruitful
i

‘lead.

d. The apparent hoati lity of the ‘current maid (see para-
-graph 24 and 27 of the attachment) might offer further .
exploitation.

e. ‘AMAUTO/1's desire to affiliate himself - with an
exercise group (see paragraph 26b of the attachment) .
night. offer a possibility to put an access agent next
‘to him. The ctrcumstance would be relatively normal, not
calculated to arouse his ‘suspicions. ‘vhe use of someone

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez

L DOB: c. 1932
‘Cuban Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain,
. accredited 12 Decenber 1967,
_ CHRONOLOGY ;
“a, RUIZ. probably comes from a huinble family in Cuba, because
‘he Jived in a solar (semi-slum area) and began to work when he
‘was only fourteen years old. This circumstance suggests that he
Jacks a formal education. Iie appears to come from a “revolutionary”
family (his father was identified as a Communist and a leader of
the_barbers’ uhion- in UfGA-13595, and a. brother. was identified

‘as a member of the DSE ‘as of 1964 in UFGA-~]

2, In the fifties’ RUIZ emigrated to the United’ States,
traveling throughout the cast coast and holding, minor jobs,

. 1957. he began to work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-
Amexican named Alexander SANKO, who had a grocery store on
Flagler Street in Miami. He cvidcntly did so well in attracting
Latin American customers that he soon. began to distribute meat in
the areca, working for SANKO (RUIZ seems to be somewhat preud
of this success). He also appears proud of the fact that when
he left Miami in February 1958, he left his brothcr (same brother?)
@ house in North Miami, a brand new car, and over $1,000 in the

bank.

In

3. Although he did well in the meat Lusiness, he traces a
large part of his success to another acquaintance in Miami: an
American of Cuban. descent known as Joe LOUIS (or LUIS). Joe
LUIS was_an_ underworld figure who was at that time competing
with the Italians in the bolita (numbers) racket in Tampa, RUIZ
and MOLEON (fnu), anothey Cuhan exile, were each offered $800
a month by ‘LUIS to supervise bolita collections in Miami, (There
is no specific indication that RUIZ took his bolita friend up on

this offer). Furtheriore, LUIS went _so far as fo offer RUIZ and
MOLEON $5,000 apiece to kil] a man named FERNANDEZ (fnu), who was

also involvcd in the bolita racket in Mianai.

4. In February 1957 (note the 1958 date, above; perhaps
an error.on RUIZ' part) RUIZ left Miami along with a man nared
VILLEGAS (whose first name might be Ilarry) and three other
members of the 26th of July Movement, They entered Cuba clandes-
tincly, ‘When the revolution triumphed in Cuba, Alexander SAMKO
went to Navana, where he stayed for a week as RUIZ' house guest.
“: GAMKO offered RUIZ a partnérship in the meat business in Miami
‘if he would return. RUIZ rejected the offer, saying that the
Revolution needed him.

5. RUIZ brags that in.1930 he was one of 18 pers
of 5,000 who were sclected by the Ministry of the Tr
where he was Vorking at the time, to take a slatistics course
offered by CRPAL. The course, which lasted tivo years,

-Ancluded such subjects as nathenntics, finance, democracy (7),
and Marxism-Leninism. One of his schoo} antes at the time was °
Marta-ARCOL, now the director of the Musco-de Arte in Havana, -

, (it is interesting to note that in UFGA-12595 RUIZ. was :
described as an. anti-Consunist as of 1960 by a Cuban refugee.

6. .UFG-1539 reported “RUIZ as Chief of the Department of
Construction Expenses Studies of the Ministry of the Treastiry |
in 1962 » and be was describcd as'a militant Communist. . In

“1963 he was in Mexico, and UFGA-11065 eenttoned-hin as’ G-2,
living at Calle Cuenavs ea 35, apartment 7. 4A report from
LITAMIL-9 in 1964 characterized RUIZ as a violent CASTRO,
partisan, arid-At5%G-J in 1964 described RUIZ as a _CUIS officer.

’ Presidential Beeree 3440 of 4 August 1964 (UFGA-19006) rcported

RUIZ as being appointed Vice Minister of Furcign Commerce,

and QUDUZE has hin appointed about that. tine as chief of. the

trade school at MINCEX, a post he held for two years. In 1967

he was appointed: charge d'affaires in Madrid vice Francisco Ramon

CALZADILLA.

. ON. THE JOB :

7. There secms little doubt that RUIZ exercise the full
authority that presumably he should have as Minister Pleni-
potentiary. The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to
remain static because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full
Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the islam
by CASTRO in 1959. RUIZ is involved in and is kept informed
‘on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations, including

trade. He docs not seem to peruit commercial attaches to bypass _

him when they, submit reports to their respective. home offices in
Havana. In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interest in
Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to
Havana on Iberia without his permission. He insists that Cuban
officials arriving in Madrid consult with him before arranging
“visits to Spanish officials or factorics. .He seems to have
good working relations with Spanish government officials,
because he is always careful to “put all his cards on the table”
in meetings with them, (The tenor of his conversation seems to
emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relations, »
personal as well as professional),

8. Little appears concerning RUIZ’ unofficial contacts
with other diplexats in Madrid, except that he is close to and
exchanges information with the Alecrian Ambassador. (Accord-
ing to current records, this is Ahmed LAIDI, posted to Madrid
on 15 December 19656, living at Calle Tiemblo 3, Ciudad Puerto
de Fierro, Latest desk traces show this person as born 20 April
1934 in Oudja, Horocco, aud as of 25 October 1966 to have decn

he makes 90% of the decisions without
explaining that: "this is the reason I am here."

. 10, Above all, RUIZ directs constant and bitter criticisa
against Havana, because of what he terms the ‘incompetence there.
In his opinion, this reneralized incompetence’ will. cause CASTRO
to carry out a. major purge aftcr the 1970 harvest ig in. (He
specifically repeats that "no one in Havana wants to make any
sort of decision"). One of his favorite books is The Peter
Principle, to which he refers constantly, and .he uses this -
ook to describe what is going on.in Ilavana, iIn RUIZ' view,
Havana-is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in
Madrid, a situation which results in a lack of, coordination
and cooperation. RUIZ directs the same criticism against his
staff in Madrid, because his personnel lack qualifications for
the jobs they hold. . He once told an associate: "They think
that I'm a fool, but I don't miss anything they do.”

JJ. In turn, he has also been the target of criticism

from Havana, first from Zoila COMEZ (?), who made a critical evalu-
ation of the Embass. RUIZ' reaction is instructive: ‘I decided
not to answer it. I took a librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot
all about it." On another occasion he complained to Aristides

regarding his program for the Embassy. Havana was complaining
that not much had becn achicved. RUIZ noted that the Embassy
had accomplished much that was not in the plan, and he intended
to answer that particular criticism itt detail.

Europe and North America), who was evidently the source of

SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS

15. RUIZ seems te be particularly sensitive in the area
of security-consciousness... This attitude can possibly be traces
to an involvement with the DGI in one way or another, but his
background and especisily his political views (see below).
would appear to argue sgainst his affiliation. RUIZ is quick to
arn visiting Cubans inst the efforts of what he terms "la
conpania, sociedad an ato compromise them, even before _

' they Teave Havana, indicating RUIZ' possible belief: in the

omnipresence and power of the sociedad anonima. He censors mail
going to and coming fron Havana, and he repeatedly states that
his office is bugged, s telephone is tapped, and that he is
followed quite openly erever he goes. He attibutes this
surveillance to the ridad, and he probably ascribes it to
the Spanish. (Note Th despite his “knowledge" that his words
go to hostile surveillsace, he still dares to express critical

opinions. openly).

. 16, This securitry-consciousness is apparently the big

reason he has asked Havana for funds for a new Embassy building,
where he plans to have a shiclded room free from bugs He. intends
to have Havana send electricians for the job and Cubaa personnel
to act as doormen, etc., with the wives of the latter to be his.
char force. He scems fanatic on the subject of not having any
Spanish personnel in the building. (Note that one Sr. VILLARROYA,
of Constructiones Aznar in Madrid, _is handling the real estate

operation.) ._ - . . . : ;

“47. RUIZ is particularly. aware of what he calls "traps."
He once recalled that he had been asked to dinner by the wife
of a VIP and, after accepting the invitation, was told that a
priest would also attend. Ne did not attend the dinner,
although it considerably upset his hostess, because he was
afraid of a scandal arresced by the police. He said that he

_, 18. Neverthe! » RUIZ has several times mentioned that | -
he holds his really portant conversations at hone, .and that he
would rather sce more people at his home instead of at his .
office, (Iu this connection, it is noted that the house ‘next -
door to his ~-= Calle Triana 44 -+- which used to. be a hone for .
the aged) fs now enpty. The owner of the apartment building . ve
where he lives is Ignacic ARTERO, a Spaniard, eee - :

. 19. RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter
and speaking in code with Havana, The Cubans are in fact
installing a transmitter on the Canary Islands, but RUIZ, -
ceharactcristically keeping:-his actions correct, has stressed
to the Spanish that Cuba will not use the transmitter for other
“than legitimate commercial purposes. RUIZ even offercd -to-allow
Spanish citizens to operate’ the station in order to enphasize
his point. : . :

20. Correct as he generally is in his professional ee
behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing ~
with members of his staff the possibility of telling Havana that
a Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there (Juan
TORROBA Gomez, cf. OSMA-25692) might be open for recruitment. “If
one ‘recalls RUIZ' constant warnings that. his office is bugged by
Seguridad, the discussion about TORROBA clearly exposes him to

action by the Spanish authorities,

21, RUIZ himself is the target of what appears to be
control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus (201-733544) who is -
“allegedly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs
but who secms to be the "security man" in the Enbassy. (We
note that CURBELO's photograph was shown to ANBEDEW-1, who did
not recognize the likeness). RUIZ has complained at least once
that he needs a'“yreal" cultural attache. ‘CURBELO has instructed |
the front-desk girl to pass on to him a summary of who sees whom
at the Embassy and for what purpose, including RUIZ' visitors.
(Given RUIZ' near-mania for running his own shop, CURBELO must
indeed exert an ,acknowledged security control).

_. 22, Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears
addicted to taking automobile jaunts by himself to the interior
of the country. He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he.
is probably cxposing himsclf to attack by Cuban exiles. Given the
reception accorded to Carlos ALFARAS, Armando HART, and Carlos
CHAIN at the Barajas airport in June 1968, RUIZ might be
unnecessarily exposing himself. He has not told anyone of
where he gocs or’ what he does, and both his. wife and CURBELO
strongly disapprove of his custom. .

. . FAMILY

23. RUIZ' wife is Nilda VECIANA, who was reported on in
, UFGA-1900G, She,is probably in her carly thirties. She is
pregnant and due: to have her fifth (7) child carly in May 1970.
“She has had difficulties with her pregnancy because of recurring

26, RUIZ' children are:

a. -Guillermito. He is the oldest and ig now 4
studying in Havana. Thore were reports that he was 4
unhappy there, and RUIZ asked on 16 October 1969 to.go
to Navana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito, i
If there were a problem, it seems to have been solved,
because RUIZ on his return quoted Guillermito as being a
very happy in his new school. (Some time ago, Mrs. Hector : ,
GALLO Portieles was constantly ncedling the other women
about not being “revolutionary” enough and took Nilda_

RUIZ totask for having her children with her instead of
at school in Cuba. The RUIZ fanily had brought four of
their chiidren with them, and later the other(s) cane
to join them, before the older one returned to school,
RUIZ once told 2 visitor that Guillermito had been

left with his grandparents during their exile ‘in Miami
and had been very resentful of it, so they had been
very careful cver since not to repeat that mistake).

Several maids to Yenve theiy jobs. Severina itterly complains

the reason Sever-na gives for her hate for Nilda. °

EDUCATION A* ND CULTURE

- 28. Aside. fron the two-year statistics course taken in
1960, RUIZ. appears to lack a solid, formal education, although
he makes up for it by being an avid reader (five newspapers a.
day plus books). He understands and speaks English and French
(fluency unknown) and has undertaken to teach grammar (presumably |

Spanish) to the Embassy: staff.

29. RUIZ appears to be sensitive to art, and he- frequently
. . complains about the general lack of culture in Cuba. (This -
~ : . might indicate thatRUIZ considers himself “above" the Revolution).
: . He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the ‘self-cducated,
For example, his vocabulary level is rather low, and he curses
frequently when talking to other male members of the staff. On
the other hand, he scems rather well versed.in international
affairs and has a good understanding of international trade. It
is probable that he has read some of the works of José Marti and,
although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of

his own reports to Havana.

HEALTH PROBLENS

30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as a liver t
-dllness (not further specified) for which he takes a medicine

called bilidis, (This may refer simply to the medical words for

"liver disease" Competent. experts here guess that the medicine

is used for anything from chronic constipation to gassiness

and constant eructation because of inadequate digestion of fatty

foods. It is possible that RUIZ suffers from the hard- to-pin-down

mal de foie, which can be found in a high-strung, hard- -driving

person. RUIZ" evident use of librium (sce above) might also

suggest this condition).

3). Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to
rest, following the recommendation of his physician Dr. CAVAS (also
received as CABAS and CALDAS), and whose telephone number appears
to be 276-77-46. There is alse a mention of: a Dr. PERIU, but his
relationship is indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to
cold weather, and was planning to go for his health to the same
Gimnasio as his son, Alejandro. :

32, A July 1968 mamorandum for the record stated that RUIZ
suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about
12’ years.ago. Since then he has had chronic backaches which were
particularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S.
- Haiti, and Santo Dominge. His pains have recurred since he’ : . r
arrived in. Spain, On 3 June 1968S he had a severe attack and was



--- Page 173 ---

treated by the “s Spanish doctor VILLALANDA (mnu), who,
prescribed cortiso: lis condition was. diagnosed as incurable,
since it was doubted that’ the injury to his spine could be :
corrected by-an operation, RUIZ was further told that. the
condition. would continue to grow worse, and that within six to
ten years he would have a defective walk. RUIZ planned to send

‘the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to

the Cuban specialist MARTINUZ-PAZ for review.

TRAVELS ae a

33.. Following are the trips RUIZ- is known to- have made during

the 1 last quarter of 1969:-

- “a. To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,
on 28 November 1969, returning two days later.

/ b. To Havana, to settle “a personal problem," on
20 October 1969 via "Yberia (first elass), returning to
Madrid on 29 October.

c. To London on 14 November for consultations with
Raul LEON Torres, returning two days later by air,

. d. To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December
‘to pick’ up an Alfa Romero that he bought for the Embassy,
returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970.

CONTACTS IN MADRID

34, Little is known about RUIZ' contacts in Madrid. Aside.
from the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about: . 2

a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to RUIZ'
home frequently. According to RUIZ, Pedro is quite
influcntial and is a friend of MASSO(?).

—

b. Carlos CARRASCO, " Another person who calls
RUIZ frequently. In late October or early November 1969 -
CARRASCO went to New York. .

_ c. Rosendo ‘CANTO (201-749310) . CANTO lives at Goya
54, Madrid. Wis friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given
CANTO'’sS background, because their being together could be “
- very dangerous for RUIZ «unless he were using CANTO for
some reason with the approval of Navana. CANTO wants to go
to Havana for a year, live there for a year, and then join. the
Cuban Foreign Service. Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ
said on & January 1970: "He is.a fool!

CHARACTER . SG

35. Superficially, RUIZ scems to be an easy-going and rather
simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and pusition he has
and the successes he has had professionally ‘in Spain. He appears
to have a strong character and probably -plays the predominant
role in his marriage. He and his wife scem to get along very well

Cuban colloauialisn roughly comparabY¢ with the pejorative

'word, "nigger."

. 37. RUIZ almost never discusses women with his -colleagues,
_ except for one off moment, when he mentioned a girl he knew .
in the United States-before. the Revolution. Perhaps RUIZ wisely
remembers that Nilda “also works at the Embassy and refrains
‘from mentioning women 6n her account. In any case, he is not

_ known.to be involved in any extramarital affair. (Still, one

- wonders about the custom of absenting himself by automobile
‘into the interior of Spain). co

'38, His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he
has read Topaz (but made no comment thercon); and he receives

- people at his home for cocktails.

- POLITICAL AND. IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS

39. Althougsh outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much
more the appearance of a man with moderate political views
struggling to justify to himself the actions of his government,
especially in view of the political and cconomic realities of
his country. It is. possible that his feclings might lie

closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution” ---but not _
for strictly ideological reasons. The incompetence of the
Cuban governrental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the

revolution,

40. In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not scem
to be a Marxist and consequently he cannot accept the role of
"robot" (lis term) required by Party discipline and vertical
structure, , :

.. a. On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX cfficial: "Revolutionaries
‘should not be coerced by forms of political control.”

b. On 1] December 1969 he told a visiting
Agropecuario official from Havana that: " ... if I
disagree with orders, I question them because I am
not a robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As
@ human being I express opinions no matter what the
risk that I may have to accept personally."

tence, lack of vision, ‘and lack of realism, he is quick to point |
out the-deficiencics of. life in Cuba as reflected in his directive
to his. Embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together, because

“there are hungry pcople. at home, RUIZ has also said that medicine

in general is quite backward in Cuba,

-: 42. Although he is probably an athfbst (or likes to think
of himself as one), he ‘ts Known to believe that "religion. should

“not be considered a handicap for persons. trying to return to Cuba."
-HMe docs not hide his-views of the American people, ecither, for
he describes Americans as "frank" and "simple". "They treated

me very.well," he told Raul LEON Torres in December 1969. On the
other hand, he refers to Latin American diplomats as bootlickers
because they use the. English language at parties, and he has
remarked that "capitalism -is no good,"

43, We seems to have a certain admiration for General

‘Francisco FRANCO, of whom RUIZ has said: "FRANCO is the only

reason that Spain is not Communist." RUIZ also called FRANCO
"one of the few most brilliant politicians of all time." These
seem like strange words for a man as security-conscious as he,

. 44, He appears to be well-informed on international matters.
Some of his views are contradictory at times, but they characterize
him as what might, be called an undecided realist: :

a. "Cuba is a political powcr, not a military or
economic power." . .

b. “The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the
Mediterranean," Doe

’ es. "Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it chooses °°
to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value

to the United States.” :

dad. “US-China rapproachment should be feared, but
also a Japan-China alliance."

e. "US power is beginning to crumble, but the
Soviets are revisionists.” ‘

Cuba and then resell to other countries,”

: 1.. The following coments of the Cuban Minister to
Spain, Guillermo RUIZ Perez, reflect Cuban thoughts on the .

Jovakian situation: .

- .. The Soviet eceupation of Czechoslovakia: has’ been .
a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet’ action : '
would mean taking sides with the Azericans. A friend
may be criticized in private but publicly be should be
defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.) The Cubans have to .
side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons.
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the
Samo ideological group. Cubn had aad still has enormous
discrepancies with the Soviet Unioa, China, and the United
States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Coamunisa
and cpposed to Capitalisn.. (QUDOZzE, 3 November.) — -

Firstly, Senor Joaquin “AUVI’ Casals was.of interest to -
D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad
record and activities of this’ man, it was understood
that his ‘departure would be denied....J.talked to Pedro
SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning this

man's background he told me that his interest was due

to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in-
Miami. He considers that, given the background in this 1.
ease, his friend was supposedly an instrument of "other :
interests". Secondly, regarding the other Spaniards,
oe we have no objection whatsoever to their departing the

i “source An official Spanish service from a source described as
: . sensitive and ‘usually.:reliable.

1. On 23 September 1969. the Cuban Minister to Spain,
Guillermo Ru iz’ Perez, called on Pedro S a lvador _
de Vicente, the Special Delegate for Latin ‘American Affairs

’ Tn the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to discuss the _
_fortheoming tradé negotiations in Cuba . During the discussion
Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which con-

- cerns ‘the Spanish Government is ‘that of Cuban indemnifications
and pensions for Spanish employees, and he asked Ruiz what the
latter could say regarding this probiem. (Field Comment: The

’ indemnifications refer to property owned by Spanish nationals
which was confiscated by the Cuban Government,) Ruiz claimed : .
that he had no. instructions on what he could say, adding that : ‘
. : the claims were numerous and that the paperwork involved was
: _ difficult and required a great deal of time. :

2. Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifica-
tions and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming
negotiations, and that the Cuban Government must provide at .
least an approximate “figure.of what it is going to pay. He ‘
said that the indemnification figure must be based on the. Sy
value of the expropriated properties, less the amount of any © oO
taxes levied om ‘the properties. (Source Comment: Salvador vo +
did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed Lt
to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that
negotiations would be delayed uatil the Spanish Foreign _ .
Ministry received the ‘Cuban Government's reply to this oy
question.) (Field Comment: Since the conversation between Pa . ‘
Salvador and Ruiz was held before the recent change of the ‘
Spanish Cabinet’ and: other. Government positions, there is no

_ The following comments ‘of ANAUTO<1 reflect Cuban thoughts
on the Czechoslovaquian situation, internal Spanish politics,
“and the effects of recent. changes “in the Spanish Government
ont mpending ‘trade. negotiations between Spain and ‘Cuba. *

defended. (QULOZE, 19 ‘November.). The Cubans’ have to

side -with the Soviets for military and economic reasons

and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the

Same ideological camp. Cuba had and still has enormous

discrepancies with the Sovict Union, China, and’ the a
‘United States but weighing the differences Cuba is with

Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, 3 November.) ‘

b. AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report . .
on the new Spanish Government which Havana calls "Opus :
Dei". Toa visiting Cuban official he admitted that
he was at a loss to understand Spanish politics but
attempted to define them. It is not true that the
Spanish Government is in the hands of the Opus Dei.

There are’ some men in the government who lean. toward the
‘Opus Dei but there are others of a very different leaning
because they come trom the Falangist ranks, These men
(the Falang ists) may g0 along with the Opus Dei line
‘because’ they allow themselves to be "carried by the tide”
but they are not of the Opus’ Dei. (QULDOZE, 19 November.)

See. Concerning the inipending trade negotiations
with Spain, ‘in acdition to the economic problem the
Cubans are now faced with another: impediment which
‘further delays the negotiations: the recent changes
odin the Spanish goverament. | It-ds difficult at this
‘time for the: Cubans to approach any ‘Spanish official
because ‘of the climate of confusion among them. Most
Spanish officials have no idea.as to whether. they will
remain’ in-their posts or will be replaced. Therefore,
‘it is’ futile for the Cubans to press them for action ©
on the negotiations. The. most they can do is wait
patiently ‘until the situation is normalized. If the
Negotiations are not” ‘held within the 30-day expiration
_. period of the agreement, it iS possible that the present.
. Agreement. can be extended. for two months. This would
be advantageous to the Cubans because during the first
two months of. the year they. will be ablé ‘to acquire all
:the goods they will ‘need for 1970. (QUDOZE,, 1 9 ” November) «

1. The AMEDITS' have dust conpleted ‘the QUBDOZE. transcripts
‘for the pericd 19 Sept This was the
second group of t eripts forwarded the Ai DIVS for transla
tion, por our trial period as montioned ‘im xeference A, in ov der
to make them more fully useful to cifferent components at Head=
+ quarters, The take fron the QUNOZE ope tion appears very
interesting, We noted with interest t MAUTO-1 discusses frecly
‘with his subordinates ‘and privileged vi tsitene subjects of .a con-=
fidential nature, ineluding matters that have to ¢o with intel-
ligence activities: — Sone of the discussions offer a number of
“ operational Jeacs which we ‘c n follow-up, such as’ the nedical.
information given on 22 September 1969 in the morning: hours,

_ 2, .The AMEDI?TS have suggested that as an aid to help them
translate accuvately and possibly more rapidly, they wenld
appreciate receiving seme original tapes iit addition to the trans-
cripts on 2 trial basis. ‘Then when parts of the transcripts are
not understandable to the translater he would have readily avall-
able reference for replay.

3. vith the next transmittal of the next QUDOZE material,
we would appreciate receiving hoth the transcsipts prepaxed by
the station and the actual tapes covering the sane pericd of
tine, The conpiete package can then be forwarded to the ANEDITS

‘Headquarters maintains its high interest in AMAUTO-1..

ng-range, in-place recruitment target. Much of this

 dnterest is kept alive by the excellent operational reporting
done... by Station Madrid:-over the past year, of which references -

| @ and D hereto are good examples

. '-8. Subject's position and total personality recommend
hin to us as a high-potential target. He is strongly intel-
‘ lectual and emotionally committed to an ideal. At the sane
“tine, he exhibts certain vulnerabilities which could. be

- exploited.: We believe, however, that AHAUTO-1 could be
"approached only. in a.classic sense: a rationally devaloped,
long-range recruitment culminating in what would be essen-
tially an intellectual and even ideological pitch. This
course of action would take time and assets, but we think

he would be eminently worth it.

3. First, his access not Only is good now but seems |
destined to improve, Secondly, if he were our agent, he
has the wit and the acuity to know what we want and submit
information accurately based on requirements. Lastly, he is
a@ streng personality who could be counted on to move flexibly
but effectively within the target milteu.

comments on further development of AMAUTO-1 as an in-place
recruitment target. — é
agent, someone with Jesuit-like intellectual training who can °
déal with him in the realm of concepts and philoscphy as required.
In any case, ve would like continued target reporting on AMAUTO-1,
