: . 2 Apparently Masferrer knows Stanley Ross, the Editor of El
' Y Tiempo, a Spanish-language newspaper published in New York. The
' office is at 78 Fifth Avenue and the telephone number is WA 4-2750, - -
Possibly Masferrer did not previously know Ross, But at any rate, either
on his own or through someone else, he

. got in touch with him in late July
or_early August and said that he wanted to be put in touch with an American
* with an aviation and military background, I do not know too much about

‘ pote, as stockholders, Mrs, Margaret Hitchcock is Clark's aunt, while
” Thomas Hitchcock Il is his first cousin as presumabiy, is ¥illiam
Hitchcock. During the war Clark was an outstanding fighter pilot, having
flown with the RAF through the roughest days of the Batile of Britain, and

a P-47 pilot. He is still in the Air Force Reserve.

Masferrer alleged 00 clark that he was representing some twenty
*“ Cuban exile organizations, and that he was worki i

with a Haitian, Charles
Forben, head_of an anti-Duvalier organization known as "Capois rt.

orben allegedly asked Masferrer to help his organization by leasing or
buying a PBY-5 aircraft for use against Duvalier. Masferrer claimed that
Forben's group was in a position to take control of the Ile de la Gonave. .
an island just off the west coast of Haiti in the guif north of Port au Prince.
It is conceivable that this is the wrong island since Clark did not have the
name of the island in question, but based on the description of its location
by Masferrer, I am assuming this to be the island involved, At any rate, , - .
. in return for help from Masferrer, Forben was to be asked to let Masferrer _ an
and some of his Guban'exiles use the island in question as a base from which an
to harrass the eastern end of the Island of Cuba.

"4 Clark told Masferrer that as a member of the Air Force Reserve,
he would have to report the conversation to the USG and could not do any- i
Shing without clearing with the CSG. Masferrer said that he had no objection
6, particularly with regard to the activities of Forben and his group,
“*:_ bat he asked that Clark not mention hie intention to harrass Cuba, since he
maintained that the USG would forbid this as being against USG policy. Clark
. said that Masferrer would have to leave to him what matters he chose to
discuss with the USG. It was then agreed that Clark could reach Masferrer

- through Ross's office for about a week, and thereafter could pass a message
~ to him through Ross.

8 Clark got in touch with me because I had known him during the :
war; I had known his family for many years, and one of his closest friende, i
: _ James B, Watriss, is a cousin of mine and was, until about 2 ;ear ago, }
: ' " "associated with the Agency. Incidentally, 1 believe that Clark has had some :
discussions with SOD with the idea of possibly use conné: with
Special cperations.
