toured Communist China after attending the Moscow Youth Festival, arrived
in Hong Kong on 6 October 1957, O'Connell provided the Consulate General,
Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group.
He had the following to say about Louis Alhonote: ~

"Louis ALHONOTE, from Brooklyn, was mentally ill and had been told.
by a doctor that he was paranoic, Once in a meeting of the American group
when one of the other members disagreed with him, he dashed a glass cup
against the wall. On a second such occasion, he threw a glass cup at
Jake ROSEN, which caused Rosen to have three stitches in his chin and five
in his biceps.. This second incident was hushed up only with difficulty because
the Chinese authorities learned of it when a doctor was called,"

China, She had the following to say in her article:

You can see the future through the Chinese people. You can ob-
tain a firm conviction that China will continuously advance forward. As a
western visitor, nothing impressed me more than the great power of this
country, Every person in New China is very modest but has great pride;
they are united, have self-respect, and respect each other, No one can
overlook China's advance; it is to be regretted that- -many people do not
have the opportunity to observe it personally, I like Shanghai very much,
_ because from the way Shanghai has changed I can really understand New
_China, In the old Shanghai, except for the Chinese, everyone had special
: privileges. However, everything has. changed greatly, I am of the opinion
that from this,one can see the miracles which have begun in this great © a
* country." ‘
