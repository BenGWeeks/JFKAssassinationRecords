1. The receipt of Keferance & Provisional Uperational Approval for Subject
wea mich appreciated, We vere puzzled, however, by the request for PQ Parts I
and II on GIciz3Gli~4 since all biozraphic ami operational cata on his with the
exception of Heferences and DIRECTOR 006731 is on record only at Headquarters os

| far ag we ere avare unless Mexico City has retained their old file en hin, . Fara-
‘viegraph 3 of Reference B specifically requested that pertinent material from Subjects

201 be forvarded to Bogot£, but we have never received it.

2. Errol C. Lythgoe,despite his old friendship with Subject, bas no present
justifiable reason consistent with cover to question his regarding all the blo-
graphic details required for preparation of a full FRQ Fart I, Nor could Lythgoe
logically elicit fren Subject the ansvera to such PRQ Part II items as “dow, whea,’

where, why and by whom Subject was first contacted or developed" Ly RVROCK, "List °

other-case officers vho have haniled Subject or whom he knows or has knowne..”, and
the like.

3. Subject's propcsed present operational-use is cetailed in Reference B, and
Headquarters hes the rest of the basic data necessary for preparation of both parts

of the PRQ. It is therefore suggested that this be dons at Headquarters, with

copies. being forvarded te Sogoté fcr updating. -..
