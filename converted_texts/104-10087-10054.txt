ANNEX B

THE 201 SYSTE)

= WD _
L INTRODUCTIN ge ee
The 201 system <@Q tal os identifying a person of specific in- ,
ire!

terest to the Operations’ Ae and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories: of information about them and for
‘producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories.-Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying fi UP for reporting on that

individual. EW
: b. The 201 Dossier: the oftical Ale es Ne ing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographi Ponting: oa < ay" individual, ie., per-

sonal history, curren ser

aN generated by the opening of
IRBs 1 Ster 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent informatidn-which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref.
erence consolidated.

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official a ial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of 43 ficer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier. bei r to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 20) «dossier Shou DBS purges a9f the following:

in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17). Any RYBAT, P&L,
or KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope will
automatically be handled as desensitized. A black-taped envelope may con-
tain only one document and must'be filed in chronological order within the
file. If there are numerous documents of this type the desk officer may black-
tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).
