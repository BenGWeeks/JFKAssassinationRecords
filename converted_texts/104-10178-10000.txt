Although VKSCARLOT-3 continued his fine production during
this time period, it was !HAPYSS activity which produced the real interest.
Tarough other cables and dispatches ve have reported his involvement in this
irregular activity, which if proved true will end in his termination as a
BKHEPALD asset. At the present tine WKSCARLET-3 is the security team leader

. for the Venezuelan delegation to the Gulf of ‘aracaibo talks presently

STATUS or PROJECT AGENTS:

. As. “gate. pertea that while WKECARLET-3 does have a highly -

recponsibie position within his organizeblon, he still is being ordered to 6

special sssignnents by the chief of the service. These assigments usually

involve out<of-town travel and/or long and wiusual working hours. This pro-

a eludes regular scheduled meetings; hovever, the agent is contacted on the

” .“gwerage of once a veek. WKSCARLET-3, along vith -his normal routine duties,
vas involved in a number, of varied activities during the reporting period

“which he duly reported ‘to the Station. He continuen to investigate all

possible leads in the kidnapping case of Carlos Domingues. In August he led
@ amall tean to Cucuta, Colombia where they uncovered and destroyed a small
printing ahop which vas engaged in the fabrication of false Venesuelan identity
ecards. He continues the investigation of the activities of Sergio Piteda Ruiz,
the Prensa Latina chief in Caracas. Tho problem of agent/case officer
communications has been somevhat alleviated. The agent now contacts the ease
officer at the latter's home during the evening hours. This doesn't obviate
the need for an RS-708..system, but until the details for a concealment device
that vill be appropriste-for WKSCARLET+3's rather spartan office are vorked
out, phone contact is necessary. During the reporting period WKSCARLET-3
produced three disseninations and contributed to one other.

unresolved case. As of tais writing, CIFENCr-4 hao been devoting all of bis
time to this kidnapping case, to the detrinent of other operations. Recause

‘ of the unpredictable vork schedule of CIPZHCE-& and the security precautions

~ observed by the Station in contacting hin, operational commmication has

been less efficient than desirable during the reporting period, while
security has been maintained. . The arrangements have been reviewed and improved,

. but the Station is looking for a more satisfactory system. The Station :

tentatively plana to request on 5-708 system for this agent in the

near future. CIVFENCE-4 contributed to tvo reports during the April

through June quarter.

En algunes ragionas del mundo, los diamantes se encuentran en

depésitos eluvionales como en Venezuela 6 en les ployas-del Sur
Osste de Aftica; 6 en una combinacién de ambos = ejemplo : Yaku~
tia, Rusia.

No todas las "chimineas" son productivas y 75% da la produccién

mundial proviene de aluvién.

Ca riquezsa da les depésitos depende:

- dal tenor en diamantes del materiel extiaida
- de la proporcién entra los tipos, talle-industrial-bort
~ de las caracter{sticas de les piedras (morfolégicas y de

color)

Tenor

En Venezuela la cantidad de quilates por tonelada métrica es sa-
tisfactoria; para el Guaniamo se puede evaluar an 0,4 - 0,5 quie
lates por toneleda métrica - cantidad que justifica la parmanen-

Es diffcil establecer la ganancia ds los intermediarios.

Sa puade aceptor una utilidad de §% por participante - es decir -
que desde el minoro hesta Gl mayorista exportador (dos o tres in-
_termadiarios) ‘el precio da.una piedra surientarie an un 10 6 15%, —
lo quay no: parece excedivo.

Son excepcionales las variacionss mayores: del estudio del regis-
“tro da ventas de los compredores que tienen actualizada su situa-
cién en la fiscalfa del Ministerio da Minas en Ciudad Solfvar, se
. puda ver por ejemplo que en Mayo de 1970 el Sr. Ramén Pais vendié
al Sr. Visnel Alvarez en 8s. 9.000,00 un lote adquirida en 8a. =
6.800,00 6 see realizando una ganancia de 30%. Normalmsnta este mfr

En verdad, ‘a través dei circuito se Opera una soleccién da las pie-
dras que trae como consecusncia un aumento en el valor de los lotes.
Esto lo apreciamos en el ejamplo del IVIC + Instituto Venezolano de
Investigaciones Cient{ficas - el cual adquiera diamante industrial
destinada a lv fabricacién de las cuchillas de diemante, siendo pig.
dras escogidas.

Oe cuslquier manere, puede apreciarse que los exportadores de dia -
mantes adn haciendo una ligera utilidad da 5% en cada operacién, da

CIFLUTE . duly
Opeiational Report for Period MOUYX through December 1971

5. CIVEHCR-' nan been handled since August 19TL by Rgar 3. MARYEGANT.

It was decided for security ressons to take this agent out of the goup of
agents handled by the Station Officer conducting liaivzon, and CIFRNCE-4
is thus handled as a truly unilateral penetration of CIRASH. During the
reporting- period allegations arose as to affiliation of CIFENCE-4 with

- SKLANCE. (See WH/Miami 12203 and Caraces 17730). The Station is avare

of this situation and the. agent {s handled accordingly. CIPENCE-4
successfully passed his ump-teenth ECSWIRL examination on 3 Octoder 1971
end the Station's opinion of this individual continues to be favorable.
(See HVCW-9612 for SC3WINL results). As an indication of the continuing
high esteen enjoyed by CTFENCZ-& within the GOV, he was chosen by CIFENCE-1
to accompany the present Venezuelan Minister of the Interior on a month
long European vacation in Septexber 1971. It is widely acknowledged that
the Minister of the Interior is the leading candidate for the COPEI
presidential nomination; should this occur and he be elected the next
president of Venesuela, CIFENCE-4 should have a valuable friend. In
summation, the Station continues to regard CIFENCE-4 as a valuable Station
esset who has an excellent reputation within CIRASH and the GOV. He
contributed to two intelligence reports during the reporting period, but
hia value to the Station lies primarily in operational reporting and his
status as a unilateral penetration not known to be in contact with JKLAE

in eny vay.

TO. : WH/3 . 20 November 1971
FROM 3 Interrogation Research Division

’ SUBJECT: CIFFNCE/4 | " IRD# 72601
BACKGROUND;

‘Subject, CIFENCE/4, isa 48-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A
who has been cf continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact.
He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wife.
He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject

‘claimed that during service with IDEN B and previous service with

TKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of
SGSWIRLs he ‘has had at twelve to fifteen.

PROCEDURE:

On 3 November 1971, CIFFNCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert
Site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized In
discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Cfficer, Edgar B, MARTEGANTI,
served as interpreter. During the SGSWIRL, the Fnglish language was
used. The undersigned was introduced as Mr. Bob MOUNT from WOCORK,.

PURPOSF:

The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar B. MARTEGANTI to determine
whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically if IDEN E
is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been
requested to work against LNLUTE; if since May 1968 he has been in con-
tact with or heard about IDEN F or IDEN G; ff since May 1968 Subject has
been inv-lved In illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utilized during
the SCSWIRL are given later in this report,

CONCLUSION:

There were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It
is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all questions truth-

fully. Apparently Subject-is unaware of any compromise cf his LNLUTE
connections; has been truthful in his reports to JKLANCE; has not been
involved in any illegal arms dealings other than Smug@ling weapons into
IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of
IDEN D and related ‘organizations; has not been asked to work against

‘LNLUTE and has received no information from or about IDEN F or IDEN G.

’ DETAILS;

Subjéct was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not
hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses,
He seemed open and frank in response to all queries, Subject exhibited
& response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDEN G. Discussion
of the issue elicited the information that Subject had received some inform-
ation concerning a son of one of these individuals. He also mentioned
that ona trip to IDEN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to
IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDFNG, Subject
also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing.
He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought
back pistcls, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons
were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E
or members of IDFN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in
illegally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own
use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings
were asked, Based on the sessions results, it appears that while Sub-
ject has smuggled ar:ns into IDFN A and possesses illegal arms, he has

“not been involved in smugqling large amounts of arms for personal profit

or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A.
Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:
Were you born in IDEN J? Yes

Did you reside in WOCORK® Yes.

Are you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKLANCE?
No :

CIFENCE-4

- CIFRNCE-4 continued to be a reliable, steady Station

asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close
working relationship with CIFENCR-1. During most of the
reporting period, he was in charge of the surveillance of.
the newly arrived Soviet diplomats and was quick to pass

_ to the Station any information coming into his possession

“which he felt would be of value to JXLANCE. Because most
of his time was devoted to coverage of the Soviets, he was
unable to give the Station the large variety and number of
reports which in the past ‘has been his custom. The Station
continues to think very highly of CIPENCE-4 and looks
forward to a continuing productive relationship with hin.

CEFENCE-4 continues to be a reliahle and steady Station \

asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close workine
relationship with CIFENCF-1. Wis recent acquisition of Venezuelan
citizenship has increased his stature with CIFENCE-1 and among
the Venezuctans with whon he works. He continues on hfs awn —
to provide Information coming into his possession which he feels
Will be of interest to JKLANCE an. also continues to pass to
the ‘Station nuz.rous reports from. CIFENCE and other security-
intelligence agencies. “Ils: most valuahte contribution during
this reporting pertod was the information indicating that a
CIFENCE officer Wad information which could have led to the
discovery hy CIFENCE of the Station's CIGRAPE operation, — .
CYFENCR-4 was able to convince this officer in a very discreet,
innocuous manner that. the--information was of no value and should
not be brought to the attention of CIFENCE-1, The officer wes
convinced, and no investigation was conducted. In the meantine,
the Station, completely dishanded the CIGRAPE operation, At .
- each meeting with his Case Officer, CIFENCE-4 is asked if there
4s anything new in repard. to this case and he has replied there

name traces and identified automobile license plates for the
Station and soon will provide unidentifiable license plates for
use by the Station on vehicles rented for surveillance and other

operational aeeds. ‘

CIFENCE-4 is chief of the operations section of CIFENCE and,
as such, has responsibility for surveillance of Soviet and Bloc

personnel in Venezuela. Through hiw ; the Station has the means
ite closely the mevements and activities of

. of monitoring qu
these persons. Also, we are able, to direct CIFENCE-4 to conduct
special surveillances of Soviet and Bioc person who may not be

under surveillance by CIFENCE as a routine procedure. The
current position of CIFFNCE-4 within CIFENCE is very good and
should remain so as long es CIFENCE-1 remains as head of CIFENCE.
CIPENCE-4 feels there {fs a good possiblity that if CIFENCE-1
leaves his present position he (CIFENCE-4) will be removed from

CIFFNCE.. Should. this happen, the Station will lose access to
D Ein CIBENCR and CIFENCF-4 will lose his

an Important position with!

he would like to have a career with JELANCE and would be willing

to work in any country of the world for us. If CIFENCE-4

_ eventually loses his position within CIFENCE and 1s unable to
obtain another.nosition in Venezuela that would provide access
of interest to JKLANCE, Headquarters may wish to consider using

hin in some other country. —

REF: HYCA-17611, 14 May 1970

Paragraphs 2 aiid 3 below:

1. ~I appreciate Caracas’ offer for possible future contac’
with CIFENCE-4.in the event of another emergency situation in
Trinidad; @ possibility which should not be totally ruled out.
I was aware that: four or five Venoruelan officials had arrived
in Port of Spain shortly after the declaration of a state of
emergency, but I had no contact with any of these individuals

during their stay here.

2. Y agree with CIFENCE-4 that it would have been to the
station's advantage to have had contact with him during the
period of the Regiment mutiny. To this end, I propose the
following contact arrangements. When CIFENCE-4 has arrived in
Port of Spain and has gotten himself set up, he should call

t

Identity A on Identity B during normal office hours (0800-1700).
One hour after telephonic contact hasbeen made with Identity A,

CIFENCE~4 will be picked up. in Identity C at Identity D. In
order to establish bona fides, the case officer will ask of
CIFENCE-4 "Are you a friend of Pedro's?". CIFENCE-4 should
respond "Yes, and of Tomas also.". Recognition signals having
‘been exchanged ard authenticated, I would feel free to ask
CIFENCE-4 to keep me informed of developments from his side as

they occurred.
3. Please provide a physical description of CIFENCE-4.

Chief, Alien Affairs Staff .

Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles (A 12 419 708)

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning

this case. - Lo .

Be The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter

‘dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of

the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject's absence

. from the United States from 20 March‘1970, to an indefinite period,

thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United
States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the
satisfaction of the Naturalization Court when he files a Petition for
United States Citizenship, five years after entry for permanent
residence, that he has been absent during this period for that pur-
pose. The benefits of this Section of the Act also permit subject
to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and
physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that,
since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and be-
fore applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted
period of one year of physical presence in the United States.

3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it
is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.

MENORANDUM FOR: Alien Affaire Staff, Office of Security
ATTENTION -:-“* Mr. John Rooney «
SUBJECT slits’ Clemente POSADA Carriles (201-300985)

_ REFERENCE : Caracas 4018 (IN 87480) copy attached

40° Caracas Station has requested Headquarters

assistance in resolving as quickly as possible a ettizen-

ship question concerning Subject. In view of Subject'e
operational importance to the Station we would appreciate
any effort your office could make to obtain a favorable

decision in this natter. i

2. Subject is an employee of the Directorate for >
Intelligence and Prevention (DISIP) which is the successor
organization to the Directorate General of Police (DIGEPOLO.
As the Station Caracas penetration of this organization, .
Subject holds a key position and is able to monitor
intelligence operations conducted by DISIP as well as
internal Venezvelan political matters. In this position,
Subject is a highly valued asset of the Station. For this
reason, the Station desires that his operational position
be protected and, at the same tine, his future as a U.S.
Citizen not be jeopardized. ‘ ‘

3. Since Subject actually obtained his own job

‘through a friesd in DISIP and made his own travel arrange-

ments, the file does not reflect what type of documentation
he has other that an expired reentry permit mentioned in
the reference. A biographic data sheet is attached which
gives the main points in Subject's background including
his U.S. military service.

4. Tbe primary concern at this point is whether acceptiag
Venezuelan citizenship for operational reasons will destroy
or jeopardize in any way, Subject's plans to become a U.S.

citizen? It will be appreciated if your office could make |

a determination on this question as soon as possible,
emphasizing to the appropriate authorities our concern for.
Subject and. his operational importance to the U.S. intelligence

effort.

2. The attached ‘outline was taken from a confesséd
guerrilla, recently arrested by CIRASH in the city of
Barquisimeto, Venezuela. When interrogated by AMCLEVE-15
“and others; the- arrestee said he did not know where the - --
outline came from; what language it wes inj and, in fact,

” sald it-did not belong to him,

2. Various Station officers and assets have studied
. the outline, and the ccnsensus of opinion is that it is
probably Turkish or a middleseastern language.

3. It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate offices in an attempt to ascertain what language
the outline is written in, together with a translation of
its contents. Although Station personnel contacted felt
it unlikely, the possibility exists that the outline is in

code.

3. Heedquarters recently inquired as to Station thoughts on
including AMCLEVE-15 in the CIFLUTS Project rather than making
AMCLEVE a separate project, The Station is completely in accord
with this idea although it will probably necessitate funds being
ahifted from CIGUSTY to CIFLUTE. However, a separate dispatch will

be prepared on this subject.

4 The Station realizes that ANCIEVE-15's clearance has deen
