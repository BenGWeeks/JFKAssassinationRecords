bursement for 75% of the excess allowable costs up to,
put not in excess of , 60% of the standardized quarters

: 2. Mr. Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900. Using
the same.formula as applied to the other staff employces
at the Station, the following would be the figures:

$2,900 + 60% ($1,740) = $4,640

On a 50/50 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he
would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4,640.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he
if his costs were $4,640.

3. I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 per-
cent sharing basis of the allowable excess costs up to, ,

CRABANAC'!s cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC!s
. cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may.
remain as written, Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his

"cover activities."
