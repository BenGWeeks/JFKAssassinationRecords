A Well, let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then

later DDP.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W?

A Yes. He was#Chief of Station, Rome.

He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.

Harvey is a Lawyer.

Indiana.

Q What was the role that was assigned to Task Force
W?

A It was'’the overall Cuban operations.

Q Did the Miami -- when was the Miami Station estab~
lished?

A Well, I think they had a forward operatio-s base down

there about 1960 which was small, ‘in. Coral: Gables.

9] Do you know whether or not they consider him an

established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don?t reflect.anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hold

the file.
@] Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?
A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
Q Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?
A Well, Iwill say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

A Underwater demolition.
Q Where were those bases located?

along that long peninsula going down there. There were a

A Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

i
: 12 i the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I
: 15 | guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from
: about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like
H . i
15 ; that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept ;o
i
16! saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and
{
ish we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because
ae some of our own island assets told us they were out there cuttihg
- 19 this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,
; 20 this type of thing. So subsequentiy, we found out that he was

f

i

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any i
: \

|

21 |
z 22 | place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he
3 5 | could.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother
ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in: to

legitimate commercial activities?

A These are probably what we. would call devised

Q What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running
these operations?

A Well, he was down ~- this is one of the reasons, as
I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that
contract, that retainer, because of the years that he spent
under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys.
Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He

like that, to see his family, perhaps once every two weeks

- to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to
it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the
drydock or wherever it was, they..had. ta remove the sugar and
put it in the. warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came
up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

|| a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained
unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn
well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the

Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Q Is there presently a Miami Station?
A Oh, yes. I
Q And how large is it at the present time?

A Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present |
time because we are in one of these periods: where: we -are
reassigning people,.-.but I think by the end of this fiscal year
there’*are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time -- collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this |

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter~

in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

A Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I

recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a ‘Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in with a
number of other people. When she hit the -- they hada recep-
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.
The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there. and
we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under Immigration
andy Naturalization Service cover. When the JEW people did the
preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill
out forms, where. were you born, this type of thing, biegraphic-
type thing. These forms’ would be passed to our-peopte who would.
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, md they felt that perhaps they

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?
A ‘Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that hac gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.
MR.MANFREDI: We will reconvene at 1:00 o'clock.

what the AMGits were.

A Well, the AMOTS were Cuban a Cuban intelligence
organization in exile. We full intended -- this was part of the
overall contingency plan that US Government had. Should Castro
ever be overthrown, these neople would be the nucleus to go into
Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

A. Right.

A Right. WE11, let me -- these people really were --

thev were being subsidized by the Agency. They were employed
bys vor cover:companies, the largest of which was called.Latin
American Social. and Economic Research. Then we had another

smaller qroup that did the interrogating and they were under

vanothér cover, commercial *cover, -- I just don't recall what it

was. But these peop.e ostensibly were employees of these wholly
ownéd -proprietaries of the Aqdencv. They were duly constituted,
incorporated, paid taxes, all this type of thing.

ie The salaries of these people, although paid indirectly

were nvaid by the CIA?

of theirs that had heen made trustee of another type of activity,

and sav, vou know, we are trving to assist these Cubans in this

type of thing. Could vour organization give us any monev, and
