pretection of CIA's interests inside the UP, WE Division supe
gests that your rolease of ‘ir. Charles Deck for this assigne
nent would be ideal if he is available, a8 no overlao would

tien. The Station was also very pleased with the work done
by “r. Deck on his last TPY to Mexico,

Co> feplscenment for Arnold F, ARENART during Hore Leave
RR RUSS BOTAN —— _
Reference: HMMA 23522

1. Referenced dispatch which reflected the Station's apprecia-
tion of Newten T, RITSAY's high level of performance during his
recent TPY in Vexico and requested his return TDY was brought to
the attention of the appropriate KURTOT officials.

2. Unfortunately, RUTSAY will not he available to replace
AREHART -during the latter's home leave period in the fall of 1964,——--
and KURIOT has ne one else they can release for a prolonged period
this fall. Since the leave probably will only be about two ronths,
Veadauarters wonders whether a technician is absolutely required.

Does the Station believe that an operations officer, with sone
Spanish and who could rorcly take over the administrative work and
make the Station contacts, couid fill in during this period?

3. We are not sanguine that a replacement can be made avail-
able particularly since > the man will of necessity need to be
“exposadle" to ligisen, but will try our best to find onc, In the
meantire, please forward the exact dates it is desired the hoped
for man should be tn “Mexico to allow for adecuate overlap.

duties associated with the LIENVOY operation during AREHART's
convalescence, He was incapacitated for duty from 23 April until
i2 May. Hie operation waa succeseful and recovery was normal, :
AREHART returned to work on i2 May in a weakened condition and
three days of overlap was allowed to provide agsistance with
the more strenuous and tirosome chores. :

2. The LIENVOY fastaUlation was found to be ia
excellent condition, The operating personnel were well diactpliaed
and thelr procedures were well organized, Tho daily work was :
being accomplished in a bueiness like and efficient manner, i
AREHART has done a commendable job in establishing and mains :
taining this highly productive operation,

The. drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10,
Dial Recordor has becn a constant nuisance since
the beginning of this operation, The preesure

sensitive tape was the obvious answer to this

problem, but the first ten rolls of pressure
tape were received after nearly four years of
struggling with the defective pens. Itis -
recommended that preasuro sensitive tape be
supplied to this operation for future use,

The tea rolle of pressure sensitive tape
received during this TDY were wound back-
wards on their spindles,

The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are
drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate
traction on the flywheel. This causes tape

feed problems, It ig recommended that three
donen new idler wheels ba pouched to AREHART
immediately, Sevoral of the defective idler
wheels arc available in this offica for
inspection,

3. Alcernative B would not require OAS authorizatic.

- within territorial waters, It would be @ cooperative system of
surveillance and irterccption favolving visiteand-scarch only
within the territorial waters of an OAS country, with force to be
applied, 1£ neccessary, by that country's forces or by forces of
ahother OAS country acting under a bilateral agreement. Coatrol

of suspect vessels destined for non-OAS country or territory

(e. g. British Guiana) would deperd on coopexvation that county.
: 4. In both alternatives interception or seizure of

suspect atxeraft would be carried out only in torrLtory of A\s

country of deatination by forces of that country or of another

OAS country acting uader a bilateral agreoment.

5. Comparison of alternatives:
(a) Alternative A would be much harder to sell to

OAS countries than Alternative B because authorizction for.use

of force rquired.

(b) Alternative A would be soncwhat more effcetiv
both in fact and as deterrent than Alternative B, although both

can be circumvented,
{c) Alternative A would constitute harasszeut of

Castro whaessas Alternative B is purcly defensive,
(d) Alternative A would incur substantially

greater risks of escalation than Altexnacive 3.

PLAN OF TERRORION IS UNFOLDING
David La Voz del Raru in Spanish 2100 (ME 1l December 1943-=P

(Station commentary)

(Te:+) Is appears as if a preconceived plan of tevroris:, Lot known
beZcre 1h Panama, hes been untcashed since members of our arucd forces
were at Fort Guifick. The durbarous death of lsbor Leader Aguilar,
teeton und kicked in Puerto Armuclies; the beating of Iniien ieter
Tzacer Palacios Salines; the cenunctation thicugh a nevsporer of a
Isbor Leader who was Hanged end beaten in Colon; another cace in

Boguets; and cany othe: known cases constitute patietic proef of the

pian,

If the objective of the wave of perseeution fs to attack the idtas of

men vith bullets, sticks, impr risoruen’, ani other siuilar measures,
it ts a stupid meve, because ideas are fought with ideas. If sone
ef the huale class try to pretest in defense cf their rights, they
are called communists. The privileged classes have used frequently
vhis pretext nst tie working classes. If ve analyze the situation
we wlll see how the privileged classes have maintained their own

monopolistic organization.

The oligarchic groups have greatly increased. Yestercay they could be

represeated in the two or three existing parties which were directed
erd governed by them; today, they have seen tie need to increase the
number oF political parties, as much as & in a small country, in omer
to coutrol the public administration. Esch party is formed by a
privileged family whose only wish is to sontinue its life of leisure
and luxury. Thic kind of live calls for plenty of soney, so in créer
to obtain the money they ned y inerease each day the taxation

of the poor, who must ray and thus sink deeper into poverty, disease,
and ignorance.

i? the people do not have work, they cannot earn money; and if they

do not have money they cannot vay taxcs. If tne people try to
erganize in self-devense, they are accused of being conmuy ote
and they ere fought with sticks. If the cause of all the e

of denccracy is communism, the solution is obvious. ‘ie ali know
invented communism, and who is living accorcing to Lt and tphotitas
Tue way to fight communism is to open sources of work to build schools,

hospitals, and better roacs.

The Rapacki_ Plan .

1. The Polish proposal for a Central European
nuclear-free zone was introduced at the 2 October 1957
session of the UN General Assembly by the Polish Foreign
Minister, Adam Rapacki. Acting as spokesman for the
Polish Government, he formulated the proposal: should
both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the produc-
tion and storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,
“Poland would simultaneously introduce an identical ban on
her territory. Rapucki did not mention Czechoslovakia,
but the head of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking
after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his
country would join the agreement, extending the ban over
her territory, too. The East Germans subsequently warnly
endorsed the proposal.

2. Rapacki’s proposal had obviously been cleared and
coordivated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction.
Moscow promptly reported the pvoposal approvingly and the
Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would be wel-
comed by the peoples of Europe, would facilitate agreenent
on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and would
“help improve relations and bring closer together” the two
German states.

3. The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957
Polish government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki
to the US, British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw. The
then Soviet Premler, Bulganin, promptly endorsed the pro-
posal ina sertes of letters to heads of governments through-
out, the world. .

4. In 1958 Rapacki modified his plan, allegedly to make
it more palatable to the Western powers. The new version
of the plan, published in November 1958, called for a two-
stage program, in which: (1) current nuclear stockpiles and
bases would be frozen and production of nuclear weapons would
be banned in Poland, Czechoslovakia, East and West Germany,
and (2) existing nuclear stockpiles and weapons would be

Oe Ae

eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement
for the four-nation area. The revised version of the
plan also called for "air and ground control' with NATO
and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control

systen..

. 5. Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal
agreement on the Rapacki plan. Shortly after the opening
of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the
‘Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation

of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. The memorandun—
basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the
Rapacki plan. The Soviet delegation is currently urging
that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question
of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, it has had
strong support from Moscow. The Soviets have even urged
extending the zone to include Baitic and Balkan countries.
Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a means of
eliminating German power in Central Furope--one of Moscow's
major foreign policy objectives.

7. The US strongly opposes the Rapacki plan, viewing
it as a Bloc device to neutralize Germany, to decpen and
even perpetuate the division of Germany, and to secure
de facto recognition of East Germany. Implementation of the
proposal would also be militarily disadvantageous to the
West. US military power in Furope would be diminished with-
out a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength. It would
weaken NATO,

8. The West German government is also vigorously op- -
posed to the Rapacki plan and all such "disengagement" plans
in Central Europe for the same reasons. Bonn also considers
such proposals as sinister and subtly intimidatory to the
West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt-with as if they
were inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creation
of conditions for their eventual communization.

. 9. Public endorsement of the Rapacki plan by the Mexican

president would mark the first such specific approval by a

government leader outside the Soviet Bloc. His endorsement

would be widely propagandized by the Poles and the Soviets

and could set a precedent for them to secure such approval ‘

by other nonbloc leaders,

CONTINUATION OF

2. The LIENVOYs had originally requested that five (5) of
their men be trained. However, upon arrival in Mexico City and
just prior to the scheduled beginning of the training they
requested that they be permitted to add one man and that two men
be included in the class from the Direccion Federal de Seguridad
(DFS). In the latter case. they submitted tnree names but said
that only two of the three would be expected to attend the class.
As it turned out: all thre of the latter group turned up, thus
bringing the class to nine (9) students, five (5) Army officers,
one civilian from the LIENVOY group, and the three DFS men,
Following is a hist of the trainees:

(2) Felix LOZANO Rangel. DFS, age 35.
sooo (2) Javier MANCERA Fuentes, DFS, age 33.
a (3) Esteban GUSMAN Salgado, DFS, age 33.

(4) Leonardo LOPEZ y LOPEZ, age 23.

(5) Felipe TREJO Gonzalez, Lt. Col., Mexican
Army, age 46,

(G) Mariano CHANTRES Molina, Captain, Mexican
Army, age 39.

(7) Ladislao SALINAS Alor, Captain, Mexican
Army, age 31.

(8) Jorge MARGAIN Ortiz, Captain, ‘Mexican
Army, age 29.

(9) Rogelio Rafael GARZA Hernandez, Lieutenant,
Mexican Army, age 26,

3. The training objective of the program was to familiarize
the trainees with the basic tradecraft principles and techniques
involved in the conduct of clandestine activities, with primary
emphasis on the work and activities of security services, Although
largely tutorial in nature, numerous exercises were conducted in
Mexico City, including two live problems which will bec axplained
later in this dispatch, to further familiarize the trainees with the
techniques involved in surveillance, counter-surveillance, personal
meetings,. déaddrops, interrogation, and investigation, The course
included discussion and reading material on opposition to clandestine
activities, organization and functions of a security service.
personal, physical and organization security; cover, concealment
and compartmentation, as well as the basic operational skills of
observation, description, casing, surveillance, and elicitation
and interviewing. Considerable time was spent on reporting and
clandestine communications, as well as on agent acquisition and

agent handling.

4, With the agreement of LITEMPO-12 {who said verbally that
he had consulted with LITENPO--+) and LIENVOY-2, the three DFS
trainees detained Hector SENTIES Rodriguez, who is known to have
chad clandestine contact with the Sovicts, for interrogation. He
was detained on the street near his home on the early morning of
4 February 1969 and interrogated throughout the day at a motel,
the Palo Alto, located at Km 14 on the Mexico City-Toluca highway.
The other six (6) trainees were able to overhear the entire inter-
rogation but did not actually take part for security reasons, They
did not see SENTIES, nor did the latter see then, In line with

‘ the discussions and reading material, this live interrogation was of
_great value to them. Also. on 3 February 1969 LIENVOY-2 passed
along to MYLECHRAINE a goce lead concerning Carlos PEREZ Aguirre,

a young Mexican who also has contact with the Soviets and Cubans,
Unfortunately, only one-half day could be spent on investigating

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees. One trainee
was required to mike a pretext telephone call, another team of two
made a neftghborhood check, and the remainder were divided into teams
to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security
Institute and tho Metropolitan Police, Except for the last team,
all picked up some information of value, and the intormation and

its significance in terms of the projected dnvestigation of PEREZ
was discussed with them,

5, The performance of the class as a whole was remarkably
good, Tho three DFS men, -because of their previous training and
experience, were able to absorb and understand the lectures and
reading. material much more quickly than the others, None of the
others had any previous training or experience in intelligence or
security work,. However, they were keenly interested, actively
participated in classroom discussions and field exercises, and all
prepared their written work in an acceptable manner. The instructor
reviewed all written work with them, as well as plans for meetings,
etc., and this proved most helpful. Somewhat unusual for Latins,
all students were punctual; there were some very small and unimpor-
tant delays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly
difficult traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons
apparently beyond their control. No student was absent from classes
during the ontire training period, and no student was late for
more than 45 minutes or an hour,

6. In summary, the instructor and the Station feol that the
training objective was accomplished, and that the trainees, although
not yet experienced operators, have a sufficient enough understanding
of the basic tradecraft principles and techniques to permit tham to
begin operations, They are all intelligent and alert men, and
except for LOPEZ y LOPEZ all have an Army background, CHANTRES is
quite imaginative and resourceful, but. also quite cautious and
concerned about the possibility of flaps and compromises. He gets
along well with all his fcllow workers, and undoubtedly has real
leadership qualities, TREJO is somewhat talkative, opinionated and
argumentative, and may have trouble supervising others, but he,
too, demonstrated considerable imagination and resourcefulness,
GARZA, the youngest of tho Army group, appeared to be the most pro-
American, is vory imaginative, and possesses considerable drive and
energy. On one occasion he had the instructor out to lunch at his
home, where he lives with his wife (they have no children). He
commented on numerous occasions about his many (almost annual)
shopping trips to San Antonio, where his wife has a number of close
relatives, GARZA, it is believed, would probably be the most
susceptible to development and possible recruitment of the group.

7. Except for the remarks in paragraph 6 above, no individual
assessment will bo forwarded herewith, The instructor has prepared
a memorandum on each man, including the DFS group, setting forth
his observations and opinions, as well as any information he was
able to obtain on the trainees.

8. MYLECHRAINE used the name "Sr, Tomas" with the trainees;
so far as is known they did not learn his true name, nor were they
aware where he was living in Mexico City, Likewise, they are not
aware that he has served previously in Mexico, There were no
incidents involving security during the training period, and no
ether incidents or events that should be reported,
