"Soviet fishing boats, “under cover of ‘fishing Atlantic waters, _
“are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.” ":
2 The boats are met-outside the territorial waters of those

' countries, and arms are transferred in small quantities.

“. On board the Soviet boats are only Soviets and a very few

Cubans or other Latin Americans who talk with those who
’ pick up the arms. The arms being delivered are of American

manufacture, including those obtained during the Batista
.. regime and those. taken during the Playa Giron invasion. The

“Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda. and pamphiets
- containing, military instructions, the same type of material

being .sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico. ,

om

A Belgian in Habana who says he represents. a Belgian firm,
'- has offered the Cuban Government any type and nationality Joe
. of arms for payment in dollars. ‘The Belgian has made a
. Similar offer of .sale of arms to a representative of an
.anti-Castro group in Habana. - .

* In August 1962 ‘a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that
“on several occasions he had been forced by the Government
_ to use his boat for. transporting small groups of men, in
_ civilian clothes, and supplies of arms. He also knew of

other fishermen who had been forced to do the same. The men
and arms were carried to small islands or transferred to other
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long.as four or
five days. The fisherman. did not know the purpose or final
destination of the men and ATMS.”

In the last elections Jagan ordered some of his (Indian) Peoples /
Progressive Party (PPP) supporters to join the United Front Party _
-~ (UFP) in order to impress the world in general and the US in particular
"that democracy in British Guiana was working. By virtue of the fact
thet the UFP membership was “growing,” it was “obvious” that Jagan

was not a dictator. I was told this by two Indian Guianese who were
working for Jagan. , . :

I was in British Guiana for about 12 months on uy latest trip.
Since much of this time was devoted to geological surveying in the
hinterland, I was accompanied by an Indian Guianese doctor. A well-
educated man of the upper-middle class, he told me that armg were
{) vedng smuggled into the country from Cuba. He did not go into any
* detail on the subject, but he did mention that his soas, who were
members of the Progressive Youth Organization (PYO) frequently brought
arms into their home, kept them for a while, and then.disposed of them.
The doctor was so much concerned -- and pessimistic -~ about the _
situation that he emigrated from the country shortly after I departed. .

Extremist And Police Activities In Venezuela

Venezuela‘has been afflicted over the past several
months with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions.
“Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are
connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,
‘the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces .
of National Liberation -- the Castro-Communist group
-eredited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil
‘fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are
. probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-

other Latin Aner lan countries.

a. Argentina: Ernesto “Che” Guevare, an Argentine by birth,
7 han reteinediiits deep Interest in Argentina's political affaixya. On 25 May,
the Axgentine national holiday, he addredsed the group of Argentine citizens
vesident in Cube and told them thet he hoped that next year they would be
celebrating in Argentine under “the flag of doclaligm.” At another point
in. this address he said: “Our revolution is one which needa to expand its
ideas...and other people sré helping us. Leb the other peoples of the henisphere
get engry and teke up aras or seize power and ald us in this task which is
the task of the entixe hemisphere and of humanity.”
The
The Argentine commmity in Cuba Isst April organized the
"Cubsn-Argentine Friendship Institute" with heedquarters in Bevans. One
of the leeders is doh William Cooke, who was for a time chief of former
Argentine dictator Peron's politicel machine in Argentina. Cocke continues
: aetive in that faction of thé Peronista party which seeke concerted action
with thé Argentine Commuiats. Cooke maintains reguler contact with sympathizers
ingide end outside Argentina through travelers and through his wife,
Alieie Eguren de Ceoke, a rapsident of Montevideo, Uruguay, who apparently
_.. .. has regular means of commnication with individuals in Argentina. Argenting
eitisens have been recruited through this channel te go to Cube for training.
There are also strong indications that terrorist activities by Argentine
| caronaste and Coiemmists hayé been encouraged end perhaps spsisted through
j this nel.

Frio Pricer to the diplomatic break between Argentina end Cuba -
last February, the Cuban exbessy in Buenos Aires. provided Linencial assistance
te anti«government groups there. An’ Argentine journalist who hes contacts in
she Uchmanigt party there reported lest Decerber, fox instance, that the
Argentine Commmist party had reeéived tha sum of 50,000 pesos from the
Cuban embassy as a contribution to the radlway workers who were then on
strike in the province of Cordoba.

HW 50955 DocId: 324293736 Page 62



--- Page 63 ---
Though the @uben embassy i¢ no longer in Buenos Aires, Cuban
clandestine assistance to Argentine Peronist-Comumist groups continues. On
19 July of this year the federal police in Buenos Adres reported the un-
earthing of « center of Commmigt and Peronist activities in the capital,
Two Buenos Adres policemen were shot and Billed et @ surburben warehouse in
June. Investigations revealed that a quantity of explosives and propaganda
were stored in the warehouse. The trail led to the arrest of one Jose
Meria Aponte, a journelist end known Perenist activiat, and one Mario
Messi, owner of the firm which owed the warehouse: It wes revealed thet
Messi had been maintaining contact with Cuban Communists, with John Wiilien
Cooke, and with an unidentified woman associated with the Cuban exbasay in
Uruguay who was probably Alicia Eguren de Cooke referred to above. According
to the Argentine police investigation, some 150 Argentine cltizens had been
gent from Argentina to Cuba (through Uruguay and Mexico) for training in
guerrilla warfare. On their retwmn to Argentina, these men were to be used

- in planned activities in the provinces of Formosa, Tucuman, Salte, and the
wooded Greas of eastern Argentina. A mumber of other individuals were ayppre-
hended by the Argentine police in connection with the subversive activity
revealed in these investigations.

be Bolivia: Bolivia hes been the recipient of special Cuben
attentions. The number of Boliviens receiving “scholarships” in Cuba this
year--between 130 and 150-- appears disproportionately high. The Bolivian
government felt obliged to request the departure of Cuban Ambassador Tebares
in 1960 and of Cuban Charge Garcia Trians in 1961 for blatent intervention
in internal Bolivian affairs, including support for Bolivian Comiuniste and
attempts to incite extreme leftint mebers of the governing BNR party to leave
the party. In dume 1961, the Bolivian government. published a series of
documents linking the Cuban exbessy with a Commmist conapiracy to seize
control of the government. One of these documents, & statement by an arrested
Bolivien agitator whe had heen in close contact with the Cuban enbagsy,
gave the nemes of a number of Boliviens whe had received financial support’
from the Cuban eubassy. This evidence wes used to justify the request for
the Cuban charge's recell.

The present Cuban charge in Bolivia, Ramon Aja, bes algo been
active though perheps e bit more diserset than his predecessors. He hag
been particularly energetic in cultiveting reletions with Bolivian canmpesines.
The peasant union in the Cliza Velley of Bolivia has been reported te be the
recipient. of Cuban financial assistance.

e. Braziit During the pesttvo years the Castro regime hes
developed increasingly close ties with Prenciseo. Juliac, elf-proclaimed
Marxist and leader of the Peagent Leagues in the troubled northeast region
of Brazil. Juliac, whose wife and children are resident in Cube, has

traveled there on several oecasions, and a number of his esscetates and rank =
and-file menbers ‘of the Leagues have gone ta Cuba for agricultural
training which 16 undoubtedly heavily lerded with ideclogieal indactriuation.
Transportation direct from northeast Brazil to Cuba has been previded by
Bubana airlines on at least one eccagion. Circumstantial evidence strongly
Suggests that Juliao hag received finencial ageistence for his nevement from
the Cuban government. Brazilian Commmist leaders have privately stated, in

HW 50955 DocId: 32493736 Page 63



--- Page 64 ---
fact, that Julieo's Peasant Leagues have received not only money but also

shipments of smell arms from Cuba. These Brazilien Communist leaders also
said thet the reason Juliao sent bis family te Giba was his fear that they
might be endangered in the civil wer he expects to erupt shortly in Brasil,

_ ‘The Cuhan government hag also during the past year cultivated
particularly close relations with leaders of the disaident Commmist Party
of Brazil (CPB). One of the CPB leaders who hed visited Cuba last Nay
told @ friend of a long converestion he hed had with Fidel Castro in late
May. Castro expressed identity of feeling with the dissident Breziiien
Commimists and eritieized the regular Communist party for ite failure "to
take @ atreng revolutionary line" in accordance with the decision of the
2208 party congreas of the Costmnlet party of the Soviet Union. Castro
approved the insurrectionary policy of the CPB and urged the leaders to
organize guerrilla activities and start the revolutionary movement in Brazil
"aS secon as possible.” Castro advised them that government reprisals against.

content in Brezil and swell the ratks of the revolutionaries. He advised
CPB leaders to give special emphasia to securing aéevide a base as possible
snong agriculture] workers and the iuhebitents of rural areas. -

The Cuban enbassy in Rio de Jenedro, iike Cuban embassies

elsewhere in Latin America, has been a source of assistente to Communist and

pro-Commmist elements. Last May leaks to the Brazilien press reported dia«
cussions in the Brasilien cabinet on the subversive activities being directed

by Cuban ambesaador Joaquin Hernandes Armag. The Navy and Army Ministers are
reported to have expreased particular concern ever Hernandex' aetivities.

ad. Chiig: Senator Salvador Allende, leader of Chile'a ;
Conmmist-~deninated popular front and a leading presidential aspirant, hes
meade at least two trips to Cube.

The Cubsn exbassy in Santiago ig the source of propaganda

are intent on coming to power in Chile through elections or revolution.

Orlende Prendes, ‘cultural attaché of the Cuban enbassy, is known te be supere-...-;

vieing the printing of Cuban propagands on a clandestine printing press in
the home of Julie Bocenegra, who also prints propagende for the Chilean
Communist party. This activity has been going on for some time. As long
ago as Aggust, 1961, Chileen officials investigating political agitation
énd resulting unrest in the Salamanca area learned that efter a visit to the
avea by = Cuban diplomat thé previous month, pro-Cuban propaganda was being
dietriouted in the area, and Conmmists and pro-Comamists there vere saying
“The mountains of Salamanca ave going to bée the Chilean Sierra Maestra."

of propaganda. .

organized early this year by Colombian extremists, ig believed to have
received financial assistance from Cuba to promote its objective of creating
@ guerrille movement aimed at the overthrow of the government. A Colombian

The FUAR hes succeeded in drawing mewbers from the extremist wing of the
reguiar Colonblan Commmist party who are dinsatiefied with that party's
reluctance to engege in ipen révelutionary action.

f. Coste Ricat The emall Costa Rican Commmist party, the
Popular Venguerd party (PVP), ie charged by the Cuban government with the
selection of young mon to be trainéd in Cube. Hiboberto Carmona and Jose
Murilic, PVP menbers,; left Cogta Rica lest June for -txdining under this
progran, and PVP leaders had plans for organising guerrilla training programs
in Coste Rica under the direction of the Coata Ricans who had received training

Gastro is decply committed to a policy of arrned insurrection
throughout Latin America. Because of his own experience he has
"a deepsseated belief that only through insurrection can revolution

limited by lack of the requisite air or sea lift. The Cubans could
probably not undertake an overseas opevation on & agale larger than

Latin America on the Cuban model. Those Latin Americans who are
committed te violent revolution continue te lock to Castro for help,
particularly from his training program in Cuba and hie large-scale
desemination of printed and broadcast propagands. Communist

agitators are concentrating their efferts increasingly in rural areas,

as they have done in Peru recently, In addition, there has been an
increase in sabotage and other violence perpetrated by extremists,

of the sort not requiring the participation of large popular groups, yet
designed to provoke drastic countermeasures by governments and to
increaée popular anti-government sentiment. These widespread

activities have demonatrated that the ability of local Communists ta engage
in terrorist and subversive activities and their willingness to accept Cuban

SUPPLEMENT
THE CASTRO THREAT TO LATIN AMERICA

Despite diminished prestige, especially among government
leaders, Castro retains great influence over politically
unsophisticated Latin Americans. He is also supported by

Western Hemisphere Communist parties and the vast majority
of extreme leftists. Castro's main appeal lies in his claim
to be the leader of a successful revolution against "Yankee
imperialism" and in the support he is ready to provide
subversive activities throughout Latin America.

The degree to which Cuba is involved in, current
hemisphere unrest is not clear. Antigovernment nationals and
Communists of various Latin American countries, however,
have made frequent visits to Cuba to receive pro-Castro
indoctrination and propaganda. During 1962, 1,000 to 1, 500
are believed to have received intensive education and training
in sabotage and ‘guerrilla warfare. Significant representation
has been noted from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Paraguay, and Nicaragua. .There is no definite
C “ proof that Cuba is now exporting arms to any dissident groups,
“but propaganda materials, explosives, and financial support are
reliably reported to have been furnished.

i
i
A
i
H
i

Cuban leaders have also called with increasing frequency

} for open rebellion as the "only road" to liberation for the
Americas; they have been especially vociferous since the first

! of the year. Leading officials, such as Castro, Blas Roca,

Che Guevara, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and Juan Marinello are
among those calling for revolutionary violence. The ;
"Betancourt tyranny" in Venezuela has been designated a

primary target, but Peru and Chile apparently also have high
priority. “ The use of the Prensa Latina organization and : o
the agent network already in existence makes it virtually :
sure that Havana will intensify its clandestine activities..

Latin American governments are generally now more alert to
Castro's threat. Inadequate security forces and widespread
poverty throughout the aréa, however, make it almost certain
that Cuban-supported: insurgency will have an-effect out of.
proportion to the number of people involved.

: C Cuban Anniversary Celebrations (See pictures following)

The Cuban Armed Forces parade in Havana yesterday

: included infantry, naval, artillery, armor, and air

i formations. The most significant display was that

' of SA-2 missiles and possible cruise missiles. ,
Ground units included 15 companies of the 2d Western
Army, units of the National Militia, and other
infantry anits in a "new parade step" resembling the
goose step. The artillery unit had antitank guns, heavy
artillery, multiple rocket laummchers and AA artillery.
Three battalions of medium tanks, heavy tanks and
assault guns, along with the surface-to-air and possible

‘ . cruise missiles made up the final unit of the parade.

The air formations included helicopters, propeller-
type training planes, and MIG-15's, 19's and 2i's.

Seviet participation in the parade has not been established,
ealvhough Soviets and Czechs may have piloted some of
the aircraft.

Premier Castro's speech following the parade brought

no surprises aside from its unusual brevity. He

made an effort to indicate Cuban control of the air
C ‘ defense system, including the SA-2's, and, in a

probable reference to US reconnaissance flights, said

there could be an incident "at any time".

rl bog

Castro reiterated the five demands he first made
after the announcement that the Soviets would
withdraw offensive missiles from Cuba. He :
inciuced his usval anti-US statements and slurs at
President Kennedy and made a low-keyed appeal for
ew iilty" within the Communist Bloc.) He called for
revolution in Latin America, with special emphasis 4
on Venezuela, and cited Cuba's "historic task
fi S Erving as an example" for that revolution.,

In the USSR, Cuban and Soviet spokesmen lauded Cuban-
Russian friendship and unity, and the Soviet
spokesman, Suslov, pledged that his country would
"never leave Revolutionary Cuba alone in distress."

i . leftist ex-President Arevalo, who plans to return and seek the

“- The armed forces universally oppose Arevalo. Some factions want

to replace Ydigoras with a civilian-military junta and call. new
elections before Arevalo becomes eligible to run in March, Should
Arevalo return, the military will probably move to prevent his
candidacy and the coming months may be critical. —

Honduran President Villeda Moraies, although not a strong

4 and maneuvering for the nomination has begun. Rodas Alvarado,

3 President of the Congress and one of the three leading contenders,
4 has used his position to build up strength, but the armed forces

: regard him as the least desirable and.a developing anti-Rodas

i . coalition may prevent his nomination. Either of the three leading
candidates would probably follow the present government's policies,
including its relatively soft Communist stand. The Communists,

The government is moving ahead with its reform program, but
there is some resistance to the proposed new income taxes.
Communist activities have been curbed, but the Communists still
retain a subversive capability particularly among labor and

Panama is relatively quiet. Although Panama has failed to
receive any commitment for a long-sought yenegotiation of the
Canal Zone treaty, continuing talks on areas of disagreement and
some concessions have eased tensions and softened violent anti-US

propaganda. Public emotion may again be aroused, however, by the

I Court to declare the treaty unconstitutional. President Chiari

| . has also indicated he expects to press for increased compensation
during the forthcoming talks. On the internal scene, President
Chiari has failed to provide a strong administration. Corruption
continues; the cabinet is Givided by conflicting loyalties and
ambitions; badly needed reforms have not yet been adopted; and
the chronically depressed economy remains stagnant.

The stability which has marked the 30-year dominance of
Mexico's Party of Revolutionary Institutions (PRI) is gradually
peiug eroded. Extreme right and left factions of the PRI are
-' vying for domination. In attempting to placate poth, President
Lopez Mateos has adopted inconsistent and vaciliating policies,
pleasing neither group. Foxces outside the PRI also pose an
increasing threat -- particularly the recently formed Independent
Peasant Central (CCL) with which leftist ex-President Cardenas is
associated. The CGI, organized to exploit unrest among the land-
C less peasants, may:also attempt to challenge the PRI politically.
To undercut the CCI,. the government plans to complete the land
distribution program by the end of Lopez Mateos' term late next
year. Although this may alleviate discontent in the agrarian ,
- sector, rising population and mounting unemployment will continue
to be major problems.

SUPP LEMENT

THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, PANAMA, AND MEXICO

Central America is relatively stable. Preparations are a
under way for President Kennedy's scheduled meeting with the Chiefs ©
of State of these countries at San Jose, Costa Rica, on 18 and 19
March. Tensions are rising, however, in those countries having

-elections scheduled this year; Mexico's political stability is

threatened;. and the Cuban subversive potential remains a problem
throughout the area.

During the forthcoming meeting, an attempt will be made to
center discussions on areas of common interest. Economic integra-
tion of the Central American region -- one of the major objectives
of the Alliance for Progress Program -- will undoubtedly be em-

-phasized. Central America, which has been moving toward greater

political unity, has begun to take steps toward economic integra-

“tion, and presently envisages the creation of a Common Market by

1965. The Cuban subversive threat igs also likely to be given top
priority. All of the Central American countries regard this as
one of the major problems and are seeking ways to meet it.

On 3 February, Nicaraguans are scheduled to cast ballots for
the first time in nearly 80 years for a Presidential candidate
who is not a member of the Somoza family. Rene Schick -- the
government's Liberal Party (PLN) candidate and hand-picked by the
Somozas -- is expected to win easily, however. Effective oppo-
sition to Schick collapsed when the major opposition party --
Traditionalist Conservative (PCT) -- boycotted the elections
because the government refused to permit OAS supervision. The
only opponent is Diego Manuel Chamorro Bolanos, a last-minute
candidate of the splinter Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN),
whose eniry into the race seems to have been engineered by the
government to provide a semblance of opposition. Castro-
Communist.elements, militant conservatives and others may attempt
to create disorders before or during the elections, but the
Nicaraguan National Guard is believed capable of-.controlling
any troubles short of.a general uprising or wel 1-coordinated
rebel invasion ~~ neither of which seems likely.

Anti-Somoza Nicaraguans have alleged fraudulent registra-

' tions and may attempt to challenge the elections. Although

Schick may not turn out to be a Somoza puppet, opposition
suspicions will be reinforced with the likely retention of
General Anastasio Somoza as Director of the National Guard.

Repercussions in Guatemala from the recent abortive Air
Force revolt have not been too serious. Although plotting

Peruvian Communist Elements Coordinating. Their Activities

Orthodox Communists in Peru are apparently putting
aside their differences and moving toward closer
co-operation with the extremist Trotskyist faction,’
believed to be leading the recent outbreak of
disorders. The groups are reportedly co-ordinating
previously random plans to carry out extensive
destruction of industrial and agricultural
installations and to provoke uprisings. Cubans and
other Latin American nationals as weil as Havana
and Moscow-trained Peruvians are said to be

‘ instrumental in this latest development.

Members of the Peruvian junta have expressed
‘serious concern over the internal situation

and hinted that they favor strong action. Although
constitutional guaranices have been: suspended -in a
fourth department ,and several Army units have been
moved into the areas of disorders, the junta has
taken no further action. It has requested riot

H control equipment from the US and says it is

ready to embark on an anti-Communist program upon

: assurance that the equipment is forthcoming.

Peruvian Junta Makes Firm Anti-Communist Move

Continued Communist-—incited disorders and an alleged
Havana-~Moscow plan to take over the government
prompted the military junta to suspend constitutional
guarantees in Peru.and institute a nationwide state
‘of siege early on 5 January. Military commanders
assumed political control in their respective zones,
and a reported 800 Communist Party leaders and pro-
Communist subversives have been arrested. The
Lima headquarters of several Communist and
Communist-front organizations, as well as their
publications, have been closed.

According to the Communist plan, subversive activity
was to have been intensified between 15 and 20 :
January in all parts of Peru, with assaults on
banking and commercial institutions, military
garrisons, vital communications facilities, and
universities. A clandestine radio station operating
on the Bolivian border allegedly was to direct

and co-ordinate this activity.

@ The junte has regarded members of the leftist but
non-Comamnist American Popular . Revolutionary
Alliance (APRA) a greater danger than the
Communists and originally tended to blame them
for the disorders. There is no proof that APRA
has been involved in anything but legititmate
strike activity. Suspension of constitutional
guarantees would enable the junta to strike at
“APRA to discredit and weaken it before the scheduled
-@lections next June. (SECRET)

SUPPLEMENT

THE VENEZUELAN SITUATION

’

A number of high-ranking Cuban leaders since the first of
the year have publicly called for revolution,in other Latin
American countries, with Venezuela singled out as a country
with top priority.

Coinciding with these appeals have been reports that the
Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) planned to step up terrorist
activity to discredit President Betancourt before his US
visit. The recent incidence of terrorism, which has included
attacks on the US Chamber of Commerce office building and the
barning of Sears, Roebuck warehouses, is apparently part
of this campaign.

Involved in ‘the current terrorism is the Armed Forces of
National Liberation (FALN). The FALN, although purporting to
represent all of the opposition, includes some prominent
Communists and is emerging as a paramilitary force of the PCV
with its main strength in the Caracas area.

Guerrilla bands also operate in western Venezuela, but
there is no firm evidence that their activity is coordinated
with that in the Caracas area. Venezuelan army units, with

air support, have been used in a recent campaign against

these guerrillas.

The armed forces are generally capable of maintaining
internal security and of defending the nation's borders
against neighboring countries. The vast majority supports
constitutionality and is loyal to the Betancourt government.
The armed forces would not *hesitate, however, to take over the
government in order to maintain order or to forestall a
Communist uprising. The armed forces were earlier greatly
frustrated over the government's inaction against Communist—
instigated disorders. Betancourt's recent willingness to
take more vigorous action, however, coupled with the strong
support given the US during the Cuban crisis, has’ overcome
much of this dissatisfaction, and armed forces’ support of
the government is greater now than it was six months ago.

The officer corps is generally free of Communist
penetration, although there has been some infiltration in the
Marine corps, two or three battalions having been involved
in leftist-led revolts during the spring of 1962.

C Extremist And Police Activitiss In Venezuela

Venezuela has been afflicted over the past several
_months with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions.
Coe Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are
‘ : connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,’
the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces
of National Liberation -- the Castro-Communist group
Po, credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil
i fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are
probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-
court Government. °

The police have demonstrated considerable proficiency
in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly
to arrest terrorists. They have rounded up extremists
responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing

- supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint
warehouse and have captured the Communist leader of
guerrilla bands operating in the Falcon. area of

Venezuelan Communists Plan to Increase Violence

As part of its terrorist campaign, the Venezuelan
Communist Party reportedly plans to mark the fourth
anniversary of Betanccurt's presidency on 13: February
by guerrilia bombings in the Caracas area. Other
Communists are to see to it that the capital is
flooded with propaganda that day. According to un-
confirmed reports, Venezuelan authorities have

charged the Castro government with ordering the recent

terrorism in both Venezuela and Colombia under an
extensive plan to create collective panic and insecurity
in both countries. Colombian military authorities’

have reportedly érawn up a plan to prevent terrorism

in Colombia's cities. ; ;

SUBJECT:  Alternetive US Public Posture on Subversion in Latin America

i. Although our public posture on subvereion in Letin America may i ° ia

be too firmly established for instant end radical revision, the following

‘analysis is offered on the assumption that some change in emphasis is

both possible and desirable, now or et some time in the future.

Bo, @, Given the existence of a Commmmist statej-of.elther mejor per- !

svasion, what is the likelihood that it will engage in subvers jon toward

neighboring states?

a. Totals ALL experience of the past forty years ; dononstrates. _ .

“that a Commnist state emanates subversion as the sun omanatés heat. 7 : ig |

b, But let us be clear that two Kinds of subversion ere Involved: . - |

{1) Herdwere-centered ~- thet is, funds, gums, tools of = ist

sabotage.

. (2) Egalitarian and libertarien ideals,

3. How much does this fact of inevitable subversion raise the probe -

“abit ity of Commmism spreading to target countries?

“ys \ How feasible is it to control subversion at the source without
destroyig the Communist State?

Usually _ is infeasible to de so or the costs are prohibitive.

For instence, the costs of a protracted tight quarantine which

' would be very high, even if the activity were aceepted vy Guba and the.
Soviet Union. This would mean iespecting every vessel, searching every

‘traveler, forcing planes down for inspection, ete, We submit (a) that

“Laeas would still be exported and (a) that by so doing we vould magnify
' ‘the tnportance of Cuba beyond imagination. tt would become a kind of
~ _ forbidden fruit. The sua logy with prohibition in this country cones to

which would be likely “to outwedgh the doubtless desirable diminution, in

stance “opposed: to Cuban ‘subversion yithout” having resolved on invasion

is to be committed ‘to & policy bound tc demonstrate US Impotence.

the Commnist State, Cuba, how uscfal is it for us publicly to emphasize
