Summary
1. . Victor RICO Galan is a prominont pro-Castro Harxist journale
ist assoctated with Politten a pro-Communist bi-wookly news magazine
In 1961. he wan
r Oo be & member. of the Periodistas Kexicancs Amigos do Cuba
and tho Comaitteo for Solidarity with. the Cuban Rovulution, Ab of
June_1965 he was reported to be a mombor of tha Fronte Eloctoral del
Pucblo (FEP). He was a founder of the Movimiento do Liboracion :
Nacional (MLN) of which he was the head of the hational frese and

"* Bropaganda committee as of 1962, RICO acted-as a Cuban agent in.
trips to Central and South America in late 1963 and carly 1964. His

.pro-Castro communist writings as well as his contacts with known
Soviet and Bloc intelligence personnel in Moxico during the pant few
years atrongly suggest .. propaganda role under Journalistic cover on

2, Little 4s known of RICO's oarly lige or oducation beyond
what is listed in his basic biographic data, There is a possibility
ffairs in Costa Rica and B1 Balyador

in the Poriod 1946-1948 and in Colombia in 1949-1950.

3. RICO Galan's prominence in Hoxican leftist circlos haa beon
primarily intellectual, In an article in Siempre in March 1963 he
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the truo
Adeology of Lazaro CARDENAS. RICO felt that this would provide the

‘Mexican loft with a political party truly responsive to the radtcal

tendencies of the 1910 revolution, Thig was naceasary, in RICO's
view, because the MUN was an action organization rather thaa a

“political party, whose momborship covered a political spectrum from

‘the Partido Revoluctonario Institucional (PRI) to the Partido
Couuntata do Mexico (PCM), and was therefore diluted in’effectivencas,
A naw party would reprosont a “third position": sSocialism in internal
afiaira and independonce of any bloc ia international affairs, With
guch a politics] action.arm, wrote RICO, the LN would covolop
natarally into a broad national movement auch ag the FRAP in Chile,

4. Victor RICO Galan ig an ardent gupportar of Fidel CASTRO and
is reported to be a close friond of his, Ia order to gather natorial
for a biography of CASTRO, RICO, later joined by his vite, viaitoed
Cuba in October 1962 for about two months, He visited Cuba again
during part of May and moat of June 1963 when he Spent olght days with
CASTRO, five of thom at soa in CASTRO's boat, ostensibly to discuss
CASTRO'a recont trip to the Soviot Union and hig talks with XHRUSCHRY.
Ou thig visit the Cuban Government gave RICG a migsion to travel
throug Contral and South Ancrica to contact local connunista and
guerrilla leaders and poraunade thea to begin immediately campaigns of
violence and terror.in order to take the Pprassurea off the FALN in

greator

unity among the varioug loftist groups,

5. In tho Fall and Winter of 1963 and late 1964 undertook thia
mission, Evon though a known leftist he possibly had somo arrangement
with the Mexican Government which may have gotten him spocial privi-

, loges and support ‘fram Muxicafi ombunaied in couatriea ‘whore ho visited.

In Guatemala RICO interviowod Genoral Enrique PERALTA Azurdia the
Chief of Govornmont and thon met Raul ALARCON Monsanto, military
‘training loader of the Partido Guatomalteco de Trabajo (PGT), who took.
him to moet and intorviow Marco Antonio YON Sosa an anti rogime
guerrilla loader; RICO possibly also met a (fnu) GOMBZ Ayau algo a
‘guorrilla leador. In Nicaragua ho mot with Alvaca RAMIREZ Gonzalos,
Socretary Goneral of tho Mobilizacion Republicana (MR) and a member of
the Contral Comiitttoo of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN). In
Costa Rica ho mot with ono of the MORA brothors,a guerrilla leader.

In Panama ho mot Hugo VICTOR, president of the Partido del Pueblo (Ppp),
and David TURNER, loader of the Vanguard of National Action (VAN), and
attempted to reconcile. them in their dispute for leadership of the
revolution in Panama; ho also urged -an immediate program of sabotage
and violonce, » RICO wont on to Venezuola to meat Argelia LAYA; he was
probably in contact with the HIR while there. He then wont to Brazil
whore ho contacted Paulo SCHILLING,coordinator of the Popular Mobi-
lization Front, During this timo he may have gone to Cuba briefly and
returned directly to Brazil, Aftor a fow days back ia Moxico RICO
went to the Dominican Ropublic whore he attempted unsuccessfully to
obtain photographs of Dominican guerrillas killed the month before,
probably to uso them for propaganda purposes, As 4 result of his
contact with the Agrupacion Politica Catorce Juaio (APCJ) in the
Dominican Ropublic ho was able to serve during the Dominican Republic
crisis of May 1965 ag a relay peint for material and instructions

from Cuba to the APCJ and nlyo as a. roporting channel from Juan B,.
MEJIA and APCJ leadorg to the Cubau Intelligence Service and the
APCS's CASTRO Cuban loaderabip in Cuba, After hie return to Mexico
City RICO visited Cuba again ostensibly to interview CASTRO on his
most xocent trip to the Soviot Union and probably to report on his

mission.

6. RI€O Galan continued his intorest in the guerrilla struggle
and was reported to have entered Guatemaia clandestinaly in August
1964 and possibly several times before then as well, to vieit YON

_ Sosa and his guerrillas. In March 1966, aftor having returned from
Cuba the month before, he planned to travel again to Guatemala
elandestinely in order to investigato the disappearance of Victor
Manuel GUTIERREZ, leadér of the PCT and of the Guatemalan exile
community in Mexico, who had recently returned to Gustemala,

7. RICO's writings show an ardent support for the guorrillas
in Latin America and for thoir mothod in achieving the revolution.
In October 1964 the Guatemalan Armed Yorccs captured a aumber of
tape recorders sad tapes from tha guerrillas including one by

Governor of Nuevo Leon, It vss almost o yeor later that Rolando Guzzan, Tomas
