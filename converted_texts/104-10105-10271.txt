that this description of the author's contact\with Dr. Barney
Malloy of CIA is very unfair to the latter. It implies that
Hunt had a special relationship with Dr. Malloy,and an effort

32. Page 220, lines 5 through 10. This passage concern- |
ing the use of CIA alias documentation by Hunt and others in-
cludes loose language which implies that still another set of
documents was prepared by the CIA for Hunt's use --- i:e., a
set of documents which was not mentioned-‘during the recent ” :
Congressional "Watergate hearings". As such this is misleading _
and could serve to create additional difficulties for the Agency.
It is recommended that the OGC make an effort to have the author
rewrite this paragraph in order that this potentially damaging
language be removed from his manuscript. (Page 387, lines 4-9.)
