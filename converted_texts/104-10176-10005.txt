DISPATCH Lt SECRET /WAPOK

2. There fis lictie question that LIRIHG-?3‘seired tha opportunity, gives
him by the sudden spperition of GROZCO on the ecene to cover vis a vis his
wife a few days of misbehaving, Instead of proceadixg to Yapachule to receive
from the FAR new contract icstructions in Mexico Gity (an avkward errangemaot
to say the least), LIEING-3 remained st the safe hocee be uses in the capital
to receive the visic (ae indicsted by LIFZAT) of Berts WICGISSER his “regular”
mistress, Silvia DURAH (of Lea Harvey OSWALD fame) and possibly a certain
-+;,  Yoleada (who appears for the firat time in thie operaticn sad whose phone
ee quaber is not in the Station reversed Hexico City telephone directory}
~ Pinned down on the fact that he wan in Mexico. City during the period of 19

to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted thet he wae but felt that he had to tell
another lic racher then adait hie misbehavior, This lie vas that he did not
want to appear dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and so

uade hio first meeting with OR02ZCO “more intriguing” by inventing the trip
to Tapachula. To add credence to the Tapachule story, LIRING*3 previously
asked his wife to izprese ROWTON with her concern for his, telling ROJTOS
that he had disappeared for three days without tellicg her where he went.
This che did very convincingly with auch sobbing end crying. The LIRGSIN
LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly thet day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck will have
it LIROSIH live moaitored » conversation between LIKIM-3 and his wife
éuring which the latter reported thet her tears seemed to have convinced

RMT Encthae sadne ne oh dok OFAN hed come nretey hient talk with
LIRING-3 coacerned the nention of the alias which RO“TON uses with LIRIEG-3
and 4 to varioue persons with whom LIRIEG*3 is in tosch, LIFRAT coverage
had indicated, for example, that LIRING-3 menticned FOcTO# in alias to
Sergio VALUEZ, This LIRING-3 denied. He produced on 4 August 1967 a
“written review of 211 the people of interest to ROWTON vithvhom he has
been im contact indicating whether or not he mentioned x0sTOH's alias to
them, This review is attached to, one of ROWTON's reports dated 9 August.

- 3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING"3, Sergio TALDEZ and Raul
MORENO ie explained {n detail in ROWTON's reports forwarded with this
dispatch, A few additional points should probably be made here. First of
all, pert of the first meeting between LIRING*3 and ORCZCO et LIRIRC_3‘s
sefebouse was live-moaitored by LIROSIN when the Istter returned home from
his regular bartending job in the early hours of the norning. LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder vas ouce gore inoperative} to basically confira
LIRING*3's report of his meeting with OROZCO to ROWEON. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MORENO were present during the night of 31 July - 1 August vhen
LIRING-3 told OROZCO that the latter was in fact a deserter from the FAR,
refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING*3 information
on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL“1 aod 2). The two men
arrived at LIRJKG*3's spartment in the early morning hours when OROZCO
had adnitted everything and thus do not know what prorpted him to tell the
truth, Thirdly, LYRING-3 Meists that he told OROZCO nothing about his
plastic flower business end it's contemplated use to ccver activities in

- Support of the Guateaslan rebels. According to him, (G02CO already knew
this as well as other details of his dealinge with the FAR. LIRING-3
presumes thet OROZCO learned this from the higher-ups cf the FAR guerrillas
while in the hills. OROZCO mistakenly apparently thought: thst LIRIKG-3 was
in the actual arms procurement business whereas his discussions with the
FAR have been limited up to now to the eventual traespertatioa of FAR
acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the PAR aseuaing
the responsibility of smuggling these supplies over the Guatemslen border).
LIRING-3's plastiz flower busisess designed to cover support activities on
behalf of the FAR, is not, matter of fact operative yet. Thue ORGZCO
was badly fioformed & LIRING-3's activities. How ORCZCO hoped to obtein eras
+ from LIRING?3, had the latter been able to deliver som: et the Guatemslsa
border erea, in view of the fact (ao he later edaitted) that he’ was stcace .
broke, fe a matter of conjecture, A desperate mao my do desperate things
end LIRING"3 could have found himself in serious trosble. Judging from the |
FAR's shooting habits it is a good thing tn any case thet OROZCO was not-
ermed during the argument at LIRING=3'e apartment the cight of 31 July to
1 August, particularly when VALDEZ sterted to threaten him. =~

4 This Stetion believes that the LIRING“3 Operation hes reached a |
eritical point as a result of the OROZCO affair, Both the Cubans and the
FAR (via Ernesto CAPUANKO Del Yeecchio) bave beencotified by LIRING-3 of |
OROZC0's ecaduct and stateasats (a copy of O20ccG's s-ssege forvarded as :
Attachnent Two vas given CAPUAHO). If the PAR is at 411 interested in
LIRING-3 he will somehow hear frem the Gustesalan guerrillas and negocistions
concerning aras and equinmm ~ti1 be reanped. LIPING?3 hee not hear? from
“GARCIA” since Juas end does not even know if the latter is in Mexico.

It 4s the Station's opinion that he probably will hear nothing directly
fron the Cubens.

5. Headquarters will note, per ROWIOH's report dated 28 July, the
relative ease with which LIRIEG-3 clains to be obtaining a falee passport
and other identity pepers. The Cubsn's passports that LIRING-3 purchased
fim Huevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, vere issued in 1953 and 1959
and may be of marginal value, They will neverthaless be forvarded to
Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these

passports.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1, According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER. hoon = T, wha
is 4 lemaie, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy
for more than 30 years. She was originaily regruited by former
Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject
was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on
activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In
approximately 1969-79, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,
ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss!
of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with
the personnel, including the ambassador, For this reason the Station
maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too

. was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly

upor retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty tothem. This
was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when
she was working in the embassy. i

- Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-
imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in
view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the
embassy, our relations with her would be termina‘ed. However, if
she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work
part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,
of course, never happened, !

- 3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive

spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received
occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday. The

Report for the Period January through March 1968

ACTION REQUEEED - RerEeENCES

Action Required: FYI
Reference : MEXICO CITY-5139, & April 1968

: During the period of this report, LITAMIL-7
Was met oz a weekly basis. Most of tho meetings with LITAHIL-7
were conducted in tho presence of LITAHIL-3, who has known
her fcr mony Foose and fo tee uuiy pecnon woo can pressure her
into reporting information on the daily LIRING activities.
Unfortunately, LITANIL-7 has reported only routine tnformation,
uaeh of which the Station already obtained through other moans.
In many cases, hovever, her information served to su; port
informatioa the Station suspected or needed to confirm. The
fellowing were factors that contributed to LITAHIL-7'e apsthy
and reluctance to collect and report information of value.
First, there was the problem of her health. Although she
did have kigh blood pressure, most of her preoccupation over

this conditica was psychowomatic. it appeared that it provided
ber with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station
requirezents. Second, and this was probably the most signifi-
cant factor behind her reluctance to collaborate fully, she
was aware of the LIRING attitude towards retertion of foreiga
espleyess in that office. in January 19468, LIRING released
all local expluyees except LITAHIL-7, and as the months vent
by it became increasingly evident that it was only a matter
of time before she would be released also. Evidence of her .

imminent termination tas given by the fact that she was given
less duties as the months passed, until at the very end she
did little more than put in her time. iith the spectre of
unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMIL-7 vas reluctant
to take any risk that might have compromised ner sicustiou at i
LIRING. At stake was a sizable termination payment which the }
PBRUMENers were opligated to pay her acccrding to local
employment regulations. Obviously, she would do nothing to
jeopardize tl.s payment, which amounted to approximately
$6,000 (U.S.). A further deterrent to her collaboration vith
the Station, even after her release by LIZING on 31 March,
was the LIRING arrangezent to make the termination payment in H
three incresents, the last to be made at the end of April 1968.
In view of this latest developzent in this operation, the
Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the Station
Case Officer and LITAMIL-7. i {
1. Introduction: During the period covered by this
report, LITAXIL-7 was met and debriefed on a weekly basis.
Her information was very limited and usually dealt with internal
activities of a routine nature in LIRING. As pointed out above,
| Her sucecvapecs t.svszaceu ucs pyar maa vue cus a auucaues
administrative duties. Consequently, she lost access to |.
| virtually everything that may have been of interest to the |
| - Station. The Station asked her to bring cut the book of
: addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over
the years, but she refused for fear that it would be missed
curing the afternoon vhen she was not on cuty. The Station i
then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book 2 |
few pages each day. She agreed, but before she began thir j
process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed. |
sne then began to compile a new book of asdresses and teiepaoae
Bunmbers, which she intended to bring out, but one of the LIRIZG
officers asked for it on the day sbe was fired. In the ead,
the sum total of LITAWIL-7 LIRING information during the first
three months of 1968 was the identification of several
photographs oi LIKING employees, the teuiaiive ideutificatics H
of offices and rooms in LIRING (tentative because she had H
not been in the second floor area since 1561, thus much of i
the identification was from nesory), and finally, LITAMIL-7 |
confirmed telephone numbers assigned to ssecific LIRING i
personnel and furnished telephone numbers of individuals and
~~ companies servicing LIRING maintenance requirements (dry ;
Cleaners, pharmacy, typewriter repairmen, etc.). LITAHIL-7
volunteered to provide additional information on LIRING to the
Station provided it was within her capability, and after she
received her final severance nayment from LIRING.

2. Finance: LITAMIL-7 received no salary and no terains-
“tion bonus from the Station. i

3. Security: Since all contact with LITAMIL-7 was
maintained through LITAMIL-3, LITAMIL-7 does not! have a Statioca
telephone number. She does not know the true naites of any of
the Station Case Officers who handled her. All meetings with
her were held in her home, thus no safehouses vere used, and
she was never seen with Case Officers in forty‘ She had no

telephone, so no contacts were made with her by phone.’ Frou.
the security point of view, the LITAHIL-7 operation enjoyed
@ long life, January 1961 through March 1968. Taking into
account her fear and apprehension, plus the fact! that she
maintained good relations with LITAMIL-3, this record is all
the more remarkable. From the intelligence point of view, it
is unfortunate that her production’ was so sinizal.

individuals. There may also be developments in LIRING which,
on the basis of her lengthy service in LIRING, she might de
able to assegs and clarify. Since LITAMIL-7 was not a
Salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing
occasional gift of flowers. In view of her tutense pride,
there is little reason to believe that she will accept money
in the future. If she is able to provide information to the
Station it will probably be done without any thought of
