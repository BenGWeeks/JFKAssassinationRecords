First Assistant U.S. Attorney
Western District of Pennsylvania
633 U.S. Post Office and Courthouse
Piusburgh, Pennsylvania 15219-

Dear Mr. Curry: : .

" Re: Jeseph Raymond Merola

- In response to your letter of March 10, 19771 wish to advise you

that the Central Intelligence Agency had one meeting with Joseph Raymond
Merola prior to August 1961. In late 1960 Joseph Rayrond Merola made
several telephone calls to a CIA office offering his assistance in a general
way in connection with Cuban matters, which was refused. However, on

' @ Fetruary 196] Merola claimed to have information on a Latin Americaa
senator who was a "close friend and confidant" of "Che" Guevera. Since
Guevera was listed as being the subject of foreign intelligence requirements,
the CIA employee agreed to meet-with Mr. Mérolz: TKe meeting tock place en
6 February 1961 and is the only meeting with Merola prior to his incarceration
which you stated in your letter began in August 1961. .

Mr. Merola was not employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. His
contact with the CIA could not be described as an undercover Government
informant 2s alleged in the Writs of Error Coram Nobis by Victor Carlucci -
and Daniel Hanna. This one contact on 6 February 1961 by Merola with the
CIA was voluntary on his part. :

Mathew McVane, an employee of the CIA, did testify in San Diego in
November 1975 concerning CLA contacts with Joseph Raymond Merola. The
citation we have for that case is U.S. v. Dalton C. Smith, et al. in
U.S. District Court for the Southern Disarict of California, No. 74-2.

~ ‘The testimony given in that trial is not inconsistent with the response given
above. Itis true that after Merola was reisased from prison be again

we . volunteered information to the CIA. Mrrota was a voluntary source of forvign
. . intelligence.

Thepe this provides suffictent information for you to file your response.

SUBJECT . ? Joseph ’R. Merola .
REFERENCE © : Assistant United States Attorney, :

_ Pennsylvania Letter, 10° March 1977,
: Subject as Above . . ~o. .

1. The question in reference is the nature of
any involvement of Merola with CIA prior to
August 1961.
2. The Directorate's first recorded ycontact
with Joseph Raymond Nerola prior to August 1961
* occurred on 6 February 1961. [It followed a series -
of telephone calls over a period of several months p
- (late 1960 - early 1961) in which Merola had
expressed.interest in offering his assistance in
connection with Cubar matters. Our officer had
declined contact until 6 February. when Merola
clained to have information on a Latin American
senator who was a "close friend and confidante"
of "Che" Guevera. Because Guevera was the proper
subject of foreign fiositive intelligence ¢ollection
requirement our officer agreed to a meeting.

“3, The last recorded contact, except for the
litigation outlined below, with Merola was a tele-
phone contact with Merola in late Juiy 1975 when ~
he volunteered additional foreign positive intel-

ligence.

4.° At the end of August 1975, Merola
contacted a staff officer ito ask for testimony in
the criminal fraud trial,in San Diego, California .
(U.3. v. Joseph R. Merola, et al, Southern District ~~ aa

detail to the DCD Miami Office, had returned to the Army and was
curre y assigned somewhere in Europe and that his address was
SUK, APO New Xork, New York 09403:

est for the current address of Colonel Haldane, I called Mr. Amos

on. 4 November and explained to him that Golonel Haldane was no longer
with the Central Intelligence Agency and it was our uncerstaning tnat

’ Colonel Haldane was stationed in Europe. Mr. Amos did not want the
current address cf Colonel Haidane— He did state, however, that Mr.

. McVane would not be needed in San Diego until Wednesday morning,

-y.. 12 November. As things stood now, Mr. Merola was the tfth defendant

and it would be thar length of ame betore Mr. McVane's tesumony v ould
be needed.

3. Mr. McVane told ine that he had been called by Mr. Robere
Thaler of the U.S. Attornzy's Office in California. Trold Mr. MeVane
that l would contact Mr. Thaler. I called Mr. Thaler who is a a member

: Amos had aircady prepared a motion to disziss if Mr. MeVane was to be
denied as a witness for the defense. I expiained to Mr. Thaler that Mr.
. McVane was coring to Headquarters on Thursday, 6 November, and said
that we would call him to discuss the role Mr. McVane played in receiving
informadon from Mr. Merola.

‘4. If this case runs parallel to many cricinal prosecutibns, the
cefense may never put Mr. McVane on the siand when he actually shows
up as this may prove detrimental to their defense. However, we should
be prepared for his testimony if, in fact, it does take place.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

\ SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola ,

1. On 23 October, Mr. Robert Starling of peD called to say that ’
Matthew McVane (phonetic), a DCD officer wao is stationed in Miami,

i Florida, had received a telephone call from a San Diego attorney sayin
Bo, that he was mailing « subpoena to him. The attorney, E. Mac Amos, fee.
‘ : : is a member of the iaw firm of Holt, Rhodes and Hollywood at 1010 Second

Avenue, San Diego, California 92101, telephone No. (AC 714) 238-1712. -
. °Mr. Amos advised Mr. McVane that the subpoena was for his appearance
.: on. behalf of taal Merola who was on trial in San Diego.

, a : dicated that the charges against Merola kad
“something to do with exporting airplane parts without a license. I called
Mr':.Clyde Bryant, Office. of Munitions Control, Department of State, to

: determine if this prosecution was related to 22 U.S.C. 1934. ~Mx. Bryant --
alled back and said that Merola was one of seven defendants being tried
om criminal fraud charges for having engaged in a flimflam operation
‘against the Salvadorian. government.’ The scheme was.to establish a

cility in Salvador to assemble and s-rvice helicopters.” The group had
“assembled a collection of- Army surplus parts for helicopters and was in
.the process of shipping them without an export license and they were

eized by U.S-iCustoms officers on 21 February 1974. Mr. Bryant
“indicated that the Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego in charge of

‘the prosecution was a Mr. Robert Thaller, telepkone No. (AC 714) 293-5668.
Mr.. Bryant also indicated that an individual by the name of Henry Maier-~
“hoffer: was also one of tne defendants and it was Mr. Bryant's recollection
ar) that Maierhoffer had some previous connection with ‘Cla,

“3. 1 called Mri Starling and reported ‘this information to him and : . :
he. said that Mr. Merola was a real operator in the Miami area, always - ee woh
involved in some scheme to buy and seil weapons but that he had volun-
teered information to the DCD ‘Office,’ some of which was useful. I asked
Mr. Starling to have;Mr. MeVarie call rae when he got the subpoena but .
that he would not have to go unless they furnished the travel funds.

not to go to the US Embassy to see a man nuncd Vermillion. The friend Los
ape. <—y.told Merola that Vermillion is the Commercial Attache at the embassy
coating. and in uder surveillance because he is suspected of being the SIA man
oe Pa in San Salvador. Merola told his friend that he did not know a man
ee 3 _ Name¢ Vermillion, nor would he ever Lave cause to sce such a man. The
friend then told Merola that he was only telling him for his own good,
and that if he (Merola) were to sce this Vermillion that Merola would
becuse @ suspected CIA agent as well. ‘ .
