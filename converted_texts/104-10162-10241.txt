Reference: HABA~20512, dated 25 April 1969

1, Reference dispatch described our efforts against AEBOOR
and stated that the next phase would consist of a 24 hour a day
aurveillance of Subject for a period of about two weeks, The
coverage was initiated at 0600 hours on 19 May, and terminated

at 1535 hours on 26 May, the day of AEBOOR'’s departure for home
eave,

_ 8. The overall results of the surveilinnce effort were
interosating, and provided us with o great deal of basic data which
should prove valuable in future AEBOOR operational planning,
Although the period covered must bo viewed as somewhat atypical

‘@dince it covered a time of proparation for homo leave, the basic
pattern could not have varied greatly from the norm, Thore wae
definite evasive action designed to shake surveillance taken by
AEBOOR on several occasions; there wore repeat visits to several
establishments which could casily serve as lottor dropr or con-
tact points; and there was an intorenting contact-on 21 May

 Q@roported in BUENOS AIRES 3009) with an individual we failed to
identify positively, : mo

give us a clear insight into AKBOOR's activitios i: ordor to holp

to empand direct developmont of Subject by Station officers,

wo would like to offer a fow conments about him for possible future

action by the Station when he returns,

the impetus for these

thoughts was ao recent examination of the files of atl those Sovices
on the priority target dst to determine if, perhaps, one of them
offers more of a potential for intonsive development tosn another,

focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its prosent

2, With tho deminont departure of BIDANDIT/12 from Buenos

ment of our target personality by dircct Staffer contact
becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure,
Through the advantages of direct assossment, wo should be

b, The impressions of AKBOUR and his wife from the one
meeting thusfar seen to offer some possible avenues of approach
which the Station may wish to consider in their plunning. The
wife, in particular, was described as being more relaxed than
ABBOOR and through hor professed intorest in theatre, music,

and ballet, it might be possible for Nina 1, MAKGANLE to
exploit this intorest and invite her to selected cultural
events. If AL8OUR does not share his wite's proclivitios
for the “arts", then she might appreciate the presence of a
fomale comranion who shares her i tereste. AbBUUR's wife
&@lso claimed is like both Americen songs and dancing, This
too, might. open the door to some form of imaginative approach
buile around a future invitation whoreby the incipient social
Folationship of 9 January would be further developed in the
depth neoded for a thorough assossuont of the target. Cultie
vation of the wife appears to be particularly appropriate
because of the apparent conflicts and tensions between her
and her husband, ‘The accounts of this relationship from thar
revious tour in Mexico and also the current transcripts from
LANYARD painta picture of an irascible and foul-mouthed’
husband constantly doing battle with a dominoor ing wife. [ft
seens Likely that the inpression of "sweetness and Light™ waien,
thoy generated during their ovening with tho Station case
officors was atypical end sanufectured for tho benefit of |
_ their hosts, This, of course, is natural with most couples
who choose not to air their personal differences in public,
but froa our paint of view, this lack of harmony between
ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct pussibilities for the
Station to contact the wife indepondentiy and offer her welcome
divercions from the regimented and turbulent dite with oer
husband. (Ne call your attention to tho reference since it
may provide some useful puints in devising an approach to
AuBOOR's wife), Their present homa leave in the USSR would

qd, AVDEFTH: The ability to monitor ALBOOR through this
technical operation wus a key factor in deciding to bring hin
under closer focus, it should be.able to provide the necessary
depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the
Singular opportunity to “ovserve" AEBOUR when he is relaxed at
home and not exhibiting the official mannurisws and personality
which he must display in public and around his other Soviet
colleugues, If wo are able to expand the burgooning Staffer
contact with Subjoct as well as place access agents in touch
with him, then his reactions to these contacts can be monitored
and our moves against him tailored accordingly,

. 3. As part of the total offort to build up a large amount of
information on the selected target. we are including es an attachnont,
&@ copy of the new Personality Characteristic questionnairo (PCQ) with
instructions for its use. lily employing it in conjunction with your
divect assessment of ALBOOR, we should be able to slowly build up
onough information on him so that the indirect psychological asseese
mont techniqvcan also be applied. The PCQ is a now form and less
time-consuming than others but we believe it should be on intepral part
of the entire assessment process focused on a target Soviot and that
it can be an invaluable aid in attempting to evaluate the varied
impressions of the target which have been obtained from multiple
: BCcess to him. An initial review of the PCQ may give the impression
that meny of the questions are irrelevant and have no bearing on the
determination of a persons susceptibility to manipulation. The
questionnaire should not be perused piecemeal, however, but taken in
its entirety since each portion will be interpreted and weighted by
phe indirect. psychological assessment techniques until a very complete
impression of, the total personality emerges. We encourazo the Station
to ucikize the PCQ and when sufficiontly complete, forward it to
Headquarters for evaluation. :

. 4. Once again, we wish to emphasize that Ileadquarters 19 ine =.

{roetion.of the case rests with the Station. The case officer

duveived is in the bast spot to Judge the progress of the case and

‘operations against the solected Soviet targets in order to insure

1. Even though we have maintained AELANYARD for a
considerable length of time, we have not been able to
establish a pattern of activity for ASBOOR., The cause
of this lack is quite simple: AELANYARD has been main=
tained more or less on a working hour achedule, 1.0.,
from roughly 0800 to 2200 hours with occasional additional
night monitoring, Realizing this, wo decided to carry
out a two week operation whereby wo used difforent equip-
‘ment. Wo will cease this phase of the eperution since we
now ‘have, we believe, sufficient coverage to ustablish
.the pattern of activity of AEBOOR.

_. Qe The operation has proved very helpful, We now
know that on two occasions AEBOOR did nqi return home

until five or aix in the morning, Mrs, AEBOOR on one
occasion launched into him domanding to know where he had _
beon,- etc. His reply was "1 have been working" and nothing
more, We forward under separate cover. a copy of the
portinent transcript involved in this discussion,

3, Our next step against ARSOOR is tu mount via
BIBAFFLE a“24 hour surveillance of AEBCOR, It is our
present thought to continue this for up to two woeks;
howover, wince as many as 12 officers por duy will be
needed, the BIBAFFiEs wil’. be hard put to carry it out.
. Other operations will have to suffer since wo are convinced
that © woll conducted and thorough surveillance could produce

transcript of 2b Fobruary we have extracted the information cn
201~236701's T.V. repairman and will suggest that the BIBAFFLE
team do at loast an initial check. Otherwise, we are con=
fronted with tantalizing fragments which appear to be significant
but defy any attempt to read meaning into them. The pages are
filled with namos of individuals that we have not heen able to
identify, exseptions being those of officials presently or
formerly stationed in Argentina. (From experience with BILOCULAR
_and other BIOGENESIS transcripts, we fcel that some of these
Rhames escapo recognition simply because they are so garbled.)

3. In the coming months Buenos Aires Station plans to ~
examine and agsess the AELANYARD transcripts with care in an ~
effort to decide whether they truly are worth the great

amount of time now devoted to their review by Station officers.
It is-our present fcecling that alternative, hopefully more
productive operations against 201-236701 should be considered
unless wé and/or the BIOGENESIS transcribers develop a greater
facility for putting the product into a more meaningful context.

4. We should appreciate receiving any comments or ideas
Headquarters may have on the separate cover material.

1, Subject arrived at 1990 tearing @ Russian recont as a gift
from his, wife and a bottle of vodka with a jar of caviar as a gift from
himself.” He apologized that his wife could not make it that evening because
she had to at.wend a “command perforrance"’, Although Subject claim, to be
under a docterts care for problems with his stomach and legs (blood pressure
problems) and 18 supposed to avold use of alcohol .or four montha, he did
accupt a drink (Seotch) and thon proceeded to chat rbout various inconsequential
topice. At about 3000 MARGANDE dropped in and a general conversation
enaucd, LEVERONE offered to prepare some Shashlik and Subject stated that
it was one of the favorite dishes of his wife, Ho suggested that perhaps
he could pick her up after the "command performance” and bring her to the
apartment. Thio was readily agreed to but since there was an hour and
o half remaining before Subject could fetch his wife, ws coatinued with
qoneraL sonvergntion, The following points concerning Subjectts past
activity came to light. . ,
a Subject stated that he had spent some timo in Argentina in
_ 1958 and that during this time he had had # chance: to travel freely
and cee something of the country. The pouple were friendiier, politer
_. and leae hurried then. He did not go into detail as. to what he was
doing in Argentina but it appeara to have been an official gisit.
b. Kio "high point" was Mexico and Lia fondest memories are
of hia tine spent there. He claims that he was able to travel over

had various close friends in the juurnalietic field including several

Amerteano (vio), In Mexico he wae a PRAVDA correspondent. tok bobecae,

the Indian praatios of volling all thelr produce at the fair and

any specific problems regarding the visa or ir it wus being
withheld simply because he was a Soviet. If the latter were
the case, he said he would raise the question with the President
’ of the United States (who was visiting Mexico at the time and
\ was going to Rold a press conference), Subject claims that as
: a result of this threat the visa was issued almost. inmedtately.
Due to completely fortuitous circumstances, Subject and three
other Soviet correspondents met in New York on thu Ath of July.
. LNERGO allegedly became excited about the presence of four Soviet
correspondents in New York at one time and carried on a very
\\ tight surveillance which was quite annoying. During this time
the notes comptled for books on Latin America were stolen from
Subject and as a result his literary ambitions have not beun
H . realized.
“ @, Subject stated that he has & 14-year old son in Moscow and
i although they mies the’ boy, there are no adequate schools in
Argentina. This is the reason for the separation. In Mexico
tho Soviet Embassy hau provision for the three primary gradas.
That ie where Subject's son started his schooling. 4
2. At 2130 hours Subject left toyick up his wife saying he would be
back in about 40 minutes. This was fino since it gave MARGANDE and LEVERONE
time to get everything prepared for the meal, At 2230 hours Subjuct called
te aay they were “on the way! and would Le over shortly. At 2315 they arrived
at LEVENONE's apartirent.
® 3, A general four-way conversation continued during which Subject terdnd
nis wife's comments ran au follows:
. 6. Thoir gon in Moscow io studying English and speako it rather
v7 poll, He also keeps fish in a L75eliter fiat wink. Subjeat was
, wnable to reoall tho sort of fish in question.

. b, There was a rathor lengthy commentary ca the system of sending
single people abroad for aseignment to embasaien, Subject'o wife
\ wad vory Gurpriged that the Americaus would send alngle men and women
é abroad eines thie wao vory "dangerous". She ctated that the Soviets

occasionally sawi a alagiy girl to a foreign post but the dmmlivation

was very atrong that she wae "well chaperoned". '

: ce, They were both interested in the linguistic abilities of
individuals asalened to the American Embassy and stated that the
: _ Americans were often sent abroad with virtually no knowledge of the
‘ Yanguage whereas the Soviets were always well trained, (Subject 's
: wife managed to get thie point across in her halting Spanish and with
i assistance from her hustand whom she kept asking for bhe Spanish
: equivalent of Ruseian words,) Cubject did state that the Soviet
ie language training system was not the greatest and seemed to give o
k . point to the U.S. system when MARGANDE eaid that she had learned

her Spanish from tupes and instruction.

d. Subject and his wife agreed that Ihuenos Aires 1s a large,
dirty, indifferent city. They talked with nostalgia about their
Moscow apartment which was only a ten-minute drive from lovely forests ~~
and streams where "a person could really relax", They’ mentioned that.
they had a quinta to which they retired on weekends but that the
Quinte wos noisy and full of mosquitos. (MARGANDE anc Sub,iect's
wife agreed that finid and Off wora tho most important. purchases

| 4n Buends Aires in the summertime.) ‘

~ +3. Conversation and listening to music continued until about 0200
‘hours (with Subject's wife oohing and auhing over American songs and
arrangements), ‘The evening was friendly and relexed and there
was no’ attempt to get into deeper political or ideological discussions
since the primary purpose was to establish rapport and pave the way for
future meetings.

individual with a fairly good eerse of humor. He appears to understand a . . , \
fair amount of English but it is hard to judge hie speaking ability since
Nhe seems to be reluctant to talk at length in the language. He also appears
to know some Georgian, He claims to know the Soviet Union west of the Urals
rather well but gives tho impresaion that Le has never traveled in the easter: :
part of the country, From his comments and from observation it can os ‘
assumed that he enjoys Mexican and medurn American records and perhaps :
even prefers tiem to the new, socially conscious Soviet. music, His , : ’
t one detracting mannerism ie a heavy and constant blink.
i Subject's wife: Subject's wife is aleo attractive and has a warm
i personality. She dresses well and is interested in theater, music ‘and : ‘ f
i 2 0 ballet, She enjoys going to the Colon but thinks the baliet at the Dolshoy-- -- :

a Their Relationship: Subject ana nis hide eppuar lu be @ coupie wits
Af not in love, have grown used to each other and each other's ways. ;
Despite reports and direct evidence of their squabbling, it would be

- dangerous to assume that this constitutes a weakness or domestic problems
., They appear to rely upon each other and complement each other in social
_Bituations to the poingghere & deeper understanding hetween them can be

“ geeumed. (An interest/ occurence wae the wife's ‘flat-duclaration that ©

point soress with « joke and a emile, All im all, Subject and his wife

1. The Station has long been interested in the fact that ‘

but two Soviets voside owrsido of the Soviet "compounds." In .

the fall of 1967 wo hogan a unilateral investigation and casing 1 :

oft tho apartment thon occupied by Viktor FILIP20V. Our : v

undlatoral invostigation rovealed that the lock on the door
of this apartmont was a Trabox--a lock which reqnires at a
minimum sovoral hours of picking. Simultancous to our
-wnilateral investigation wo loarnod of FILIPPOV's planned
PCS departure, We also loasnod that the Soviets intended to
koop his apartmont and that it was ta be occupied by FILIPPOV's
‘yopLacemont, In mid-January wo déaided to send BIBAFFLE-3 to
tho apartmont building iu order to betyiend the portero, We
had hoped that tho porter would be able to furnish us with @
key to the apartment. On 25 January we learned that Ivan —
ALFERYEV was arriving in Buenos Airvs on 27 January. Une
fortunately time had run out on us, We therefore decided to j
turn to BIOGENESIS.

\ -Qj° There wore sevyoral reasovs for this decision, First

‘of all, we do not doubt tho operational value of having an

nud! 9 instal tation in the apartment of an idontifiod senior

KGB Officer, However, a unilatoral installation 38 a difzicult
and at times risky operation. Connidoring this and matching
it against tho potentinl tuko ef the operation wo folt that a:
joint operation vould ho more prnotivnal, Cost also intluonced
our docision, At the aamo time our exporionce with BYOGENES IS~
din the "Vista" operation showed that BIOGENESIS was porgectly
willing to give ua and only us the tapos from ths audic
Anatallation,. ;

3. As Oxytained in Reyerence A we briefed BIOGENESIS
in the early afternoon of 25 January. BIOGENESIS immediately
issved instructions that the portero of tho building be
approachod, This was accompi ished Successtully in the
late afternoon of tho same dsuy. Unfortunately the portero
did not have a koy, The same night a BIOGENESIS team of
three (including BIBAFFLE-3 nnd BIOGENESIS-14) attempted

“9
in vain to pick the lock. In the course of this lock- in
picking exercise PIBAFFLE-3 had to identify BIOGENESIS ' 4
interest in tho apartment to the owner of tho neighboring \ ad
apartment, Fortunatoly this individual is wealthy and '

was cooperative,

4. Once we had been forced to temporarily withdraw
(ALFERYEV occupied the apartment on 27 January), we
obtained through BIOGENESIS the bluoprints of the target
apartment and tho apartments which abutted. A study of
theso bluoprints shows that the apartment belonging to
tho woalthy coopsrative neighbor has a maid's room which
sharos the wall of the living room of ALFERYEV's.
apartmont., Wo pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested
that they onlist the further cooporntion of the owner in
ordor that a microphone could bo installed through the
common wall, Unfortunately tho owner had departed for -
gevernl weeks leave, .

8. Tho owner should be back in ‘Buonos Aires at
_this time and wo havo instructed BIOGENFSIS to approach
him again and to move on with tho sporation.. We are also ©
presontly working on an LP. ‘ sos :
