Dear Mr. Maden,

Mr. Whitehouse’ has had sinus trouble off and on
for many years, This has been increased recently,
probably due to-pressure changes in aircraft,

It has ‘been. advised that he have a nasal operation

for deviated septum, “This structural defect is in
“no way related to his occupation.

he wos unwilling to fly at night. I gsve him 1§ hours of air time
and recommended: he be used only 6 as a compilot on groinds of poor
head work. :

: ‘ec. Iden B = He {a an older pilot who would bounce the airplane

to let it down easy. He-also wanted to fearher the wrorg engine |

after one wos cut. Recommended he only be used as a co-pilot.

a. Iden De He had been fiying in and around Iden J for several -
years, however, in his training he was quite sloppy in his flying.:
he would not come within 20° of assigned heading turma et the begining.

Dear Captain Whitehouse:

Thank you. for your views and observations contained —
1964. Your interost 13: !

in your letter of 22 October

Contrary to the information on which you base you
desire to discuss.Cuban satters, be advised that this:
- agency fa not. rendering help to Cuban organizations.

Thus it is believed that a discussion of this topic would

‘not be of benefit to either of us.

Thank you again for your interest.
