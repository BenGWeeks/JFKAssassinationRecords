DATES LOCATION AGENCY TASK

GERENDE was: recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from
the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance
team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data
on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of
the tean.

He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
processor of tapes. He exailed in this type of work because of his bi-
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his div er-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permited him to spot
operational leads,

Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobiie photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic t ake
and services the majority of the accomodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation

He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited
to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career. The Station : ‘
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
3 a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very

ittle time.

Reference: HMMW-122&4 dated 24 Jamary 1964

: 1. Station Mexico City fully arrecs vith Headquarters evaluation of Subject as

: a "valueble long term asset with stay behind potential.” In order to place the matter
of the 2,100 pesos in the apropriste frame of reference it is felt that a few cack-
ground points should be noted.

In Jemary 1956 the LIEMPTY/LILYRIC basehouse was set up end placed in operation

in a site which provided vistml ecverave of the LIMGRICK installetion. A deposit of
; three months rent was made per terz3 of the rental contract at the: time (2,160 pesos.)
: In April 1962 the building in which LILMPTY/LILYRIC 1s located was sold by the owner,
Normally the rental deposit would have been trmnsferred to the new comer es part of
the sole transaction. However, ad .roximately three months after the transfer of the
property to the new omer, the rental deposit was returned to the besehouse operator,
LIS4PTY-13. The deposit was then returned to GSRENDS, GERENDE efd not inform the
then LISt°TY case officer nor the present case officer of the retumm of the LI-MPTY/
LILYRIC ceposit. This 2,100 veses continued to be carrted on the otetion doors as
en outstanding operntional advance charged to O-RNDE. Gis used part of this
2,100 pesos to make leans to two s:b-acents (LI-MHTY-6 ami LIQLTY-9.) It is vrobably
that he also used sore of this on ocassion for his own purposes.

: On 16 October 1963 GERENDE returned ths 2,100 pesos to the case officer and the

. Station hes. adjusted its books to rerlect the return of this money. GSRENDE noted

: at the tine of the return that he had this money intact but did nct know how to fo

' about returning it so long after having received it. This is the sase as he stated at
he time of the LCFLUCT=R interview. GERENDES was obviossly inpressed with his inability
to "beat" the LCFIUITER. He was sincerely reaorseful when talking to the case officer

ebout the incident and has tvice stated that nothing of this nature would happen again.
With the reality of suture LCPLUTTER tests set firmly in OzRENDZ's mind, it is believed
that he will not atcenpt any such action again.

As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than perfoife re-LCPLUITS:) to
prevent recurrence it sust be roted that GZRUNDE kept ezart the 2,160 pesos which vers
really stil. charged to hia and the Station had no way of knowin; thet the norey hai
been returned to nia by the tasehousexeeper. Only when the close <cwn of the LINZ,
LILYRIC tasehouse would be effected would the Statlon expect to have the rental dep:
returned. Until such tize the ceposit would remain charged to GAR5NDE. The only eny
to completely safeguard arainst this type of action would be for case officer to
meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby elininating GARQD=E from the operetia
ani causing unaccepteble security risks. It is believed that periodic LCFLUITER of
GERENDE is the best insurance against a siztlar occurence in the future.

it

As to GERSIDE's regular operational revolving fund, irregularities have never
veen discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are ca.!ucted b: the
case officer to control the unspent portion of the revolving fund ty cozparison with
accountings (receipts) GARENDS takes every tvo weeks, GJUNDE's revolving fund {s
kept at the ninicum asount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for vhich
GERENDZ is responsible.

The “other false claims" G=R=NDE adzitted making involved occasional use of his
GP vehicle for personal driving while entering all receipts for gas cn his KUBARK
accountings. Station does not consider this a major problem. If GacJNDzZ used his «
cay for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him would be relatively
easy (i.e., surveilling only when he {a using his QP vehicle) and it is believed that
latitude mst te allowed in this area for indigenous agents.

2. In the area of GEREND2's moraleand his statement that he “is not being
utilized to his full potential” the Station is as fully concerned as Headquarters. It
should be noted however, that GCRENDE has never written the report setting rorth what
he thinks he can do and when proided on this has stated that he had been thinking about
whet additional work he could assume and that he "just does not know". The reason he
gives is he docs not know what elce is being dame in the operations area other than thet!
to Which he is already exposed. Adlditional operational work is assigned to G“RENNS
when this can be done securely and taking into account cocmpartmentation of operaticns.
An example of this was his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station is reluctant
to expose G=R-2DE to additional operations only for the purpose of ‘tsproving his norale”
since he already has considerable knowlejge of many Station past and going operations.
The Station appreciates Headquarters comments on the resulta of OSRENDZ's LCFLUTITR
and will make every effort to dctermine the best possible utilization of G:R20s8 in

REP: HMIN-12065

1. Reference is made to the results :f the LCFLUTTER interview
of Raymond HW. GERENDE which was held on 8 Uctober 1963, Headquarters
would like to have a progress report on what steps have been taken
by the Case Officer with regard to the 2,100 pesos which he had
kept but belc ged to KUBARK. Headquarters is also Jnterested in
what has been done about other false claims he admitted making in
his accountings, and what precautiony are being taken to see that
this does not continue in the future.

2. The Station's comments are requested on GERENDE's statement
that he is not being utilized to his {ull potential and that he
often has free tice, Headquarters would be interested in seeing
& copy of the report which the LCFLUTTER examiner suggested he write,
setting forth what he (G24LNDE) thintn he can do and what he would
like to do. Headquarters consicors GERENDE a valuable long turn
asset with staybehing potential, and it is hoped that the Station
will do what it can within the limits of security, to raise his murale
and see that KUBARK igs receiving full benefit of his serviccs.

INDENING CAM BE JUDGED

1, By reference Subject's annual saiary was increased t to its present
figure of US $5, 040,00,

2, Station hereby requests a further increase in Subject's annual
salary to US $5, 500.00 based upon Subject's outstanding performance as
Principal Agent in the LIEMPTY project, The latest LLEMPTY Project

Renewal Request, recently forwarded to Headquarters, detailed GERENDE's
duties, In Station’ 5 opinion, the noted salary increase is considered justified
not only from agent's excellent job performance, but also as an incentive
to continued superior work as well as an offset to the inflationary trend of
the cost of living in Mexico,

3. It is requested that Headquarters initlate the appropriate amend-

ment to GERENDE's contract Increasing his yearly salary to themted figure
of US $5, £0, 00 to be effective 1 January 1962,

! 1, The referenced dispatch forwarded the most recent contract
amendment raising GERENDE's salary to $4, 560.00 per year,

2. In the Statton's opinion, GERENDE's continued Superlor per-
formance of his LIEMPTY Principal Agent duties justifies another salary
increase, Headquarters attention is invited to the recent Request for Renewal
of Project LIEMPTY wherein GERENDE's duties were specified,

3. It is requested that Headquarters initiate an appropriate amend-

ment to GERENDE's contract increasing his yearly compensation to
$5,040.00, This amendment should be effective 1 January 1961,

SEFERENCEST

HMMA-15979, KAPOK-1842 dated 18 November 1960

1. In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60,
Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the
following information, including recognition signals and bona fides, is
forwarded for Headquarters records, Due to the sensitivity of the information,
it was believed more appropriate to forward it separately rather than to
include ir with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY).

2, Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could
probably be contacted at one of the following places:

. Present Residence: IDENTITY A

b. Mother's Residence: : IDENTITY B

c. Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C

3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language,
are to be used as indicated:

CONTACT: "Mr. (GERENDE-true name), I bring the most
sincere wishes and greetings from your Aunt
and Uncle."

GERENDE: “Then you are referring to the IDENTITY D,”

CONTACT: "No, Iam referring to your other relatives in
South Carolina, the IDENTITY E ."

GERENDE: "Yes, Auntie is my Mother's sister."

4, For use as physical bona fides, the Station Is forwarding a one peso
note with the serial number 1348510 for Headquarters files, GERENDE has
been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, to
keep in a safe place pendin;: his having to show it to some future KUBARK contact.
It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical

bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and

accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona
fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact's
bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).

5. Assuming that adequate time will be available at the beginning of an
emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret
Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E
addresses, -

1, Forwarded herewith as Attachment No, One is GERLNDE's signed :
contract amendment, GERENDE is most: appreciative for the raise in salary
and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment claus>,

2. The Station interprets the Terminal Payment clause to mean any

termination by the Government or acceptance of GERENDE’s resiynation in
the “best interests of the Government,"" Examples in ceanection with the "best
interests of ihe Government” interpretation would involve GERENDE’s resignation
for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a change of residence
to some geographical area where his services could noi be utilized by KUBARK,
Assuming that no security problems are involved in making such s payment, the

|. station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to GERENDE's estate
in the event of his death while in the ernploy of KUBARK,

3, The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as 7 . ‘
originally requested and concurs in Headquarters reasoning, Certa tnly, the Station
would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he hag been so informed,
if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money or to pursue some other
carcer, The Siation hastens to add, however, that to the besz of ita knowledge,
GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK Job,

4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No, Two are the
original and one copy of the contract amendment dated | September i957, Head- '
quarters wili note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by
the Chief of Station, bur was not formally witnessed, Ic is suggested that Matthew
S. DINGLEY (ps), who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the
document, DINGLEY was the Case Officer handling GERENDE at the time this
amendment became effective,

In reviewing the last contract amendment, it came to note

sentence amen spe nee as ciancrarnsicten » omsengmnt th Meat Tt

that CPD was deleting the original compensation figure of $3600
i instead of the figure sent by the Station which was $4080. In
checking this out, we find that we have no copy or notification
of the amendment deted 1 September 1957 increasing his salary
from $3600 to $4080, CPD is rewritting the contract without

i using a compensation figure for the amount to be deleted,

: When we send this to the field, ask then to send us a copy

of the contract amendment, dated 1 September 1957, Also inform , ,
them that they are to execute and retain the original copy of this ;

new contract amendment. It may be well to point gat that Subject's
termination clause stipulates that he will received this benefit
only if we terminate the contéact.

HMMW- 5626, 3 December 1957

.

1, Raymond H. GERENDE was initially employed by the Station on 18 March
1955 under provisions of an oral agreement, Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE
was placed under a written contract, prepared by Headquarters, with an annual
salary of $3,600.00, On 1 September 1957 his contract was amended to increase
his salary to $4,080.00 per annum, which is the salary he is presently receiving.
It is requested that a new two year coniract he prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959,
providing an increase in salary to $4,500.00 per annum and including a termination
clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary,
calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for
each full year of his KUBARK employment. All other provisions of GERENDE's
initial contract should remain in force, (The increase in salary to $4, 560,09
per annum is already covered by the LIEMPTY Project.)

2, As pointed out in the attachment to HMMA-11368, 22 October 1958,
paragraph three of MEXI-2836, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Field
Project Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station assct who carries
a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility, He is the
LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA base
houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans~
lation service and all the agents participating in these activities, He performs
his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent
abilities are showing continued improvement,

3, Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the
Station was considering amending GERENDE's contract to provide for some type

of retirement benefits, Although it is recognized that indigenous agents are not
usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should
have monetary incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with
KUBARK, Accordingly, the Station recommends thac GERENDE's new contract
provide for a termination settlement of one month's galary for each full year that
he has worked for KUBARK. In other words, should GERENDE's career with
KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this period is $3,000.
then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16,000.00. After
.considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several
other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting
the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make
KUBARK acarcer, The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date
for the coinputation of GERENDE's termination benefits,

the beginning dete for the ooapytation of G4iCaDH's termination bensfite, The
Station believes that thie benefit will provide GERNDE with the necessary

additional elenent of control.

2. As pointed out in tha LI'MPTY Project Approval, CZNVNDE, an indigenous

SECRET

OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF
RATMOND H, GEKENDE'S
OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES

1, SITUATION

As a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK flap, it was decided by the Chief
of Station on 59 Jume 1958 that Quinton N, CUSLER would assume dircct contact
with several of Matthew S, DINGLEY’s agents, one of whom was Raymond H,
GERENDE, After being tarroduced to GERENDE by DINGLEY on } July 1958,
OUSLER assumed contact responatbilities with GERENDE on 2 July 1958, On ~~~
18 July 1958, the Chief of Stattod decided that OUSLER should be ags{yned
permanent responsibility for the ‘management and handling of GERENDE and
GEKENDE's operations, ;

2, PURPOSE ,

The purpose of this operational securtty review ia threefold:

a, To identify possible security problems and conditions;

b, To establish a framework jor recommendations which will
result in the Station's subintssion of a new support project
(LIEMPTY) with Raymond H,. GERENDE as a principal agant; and

c To acquaint the new case officer with the operational problems
and agent personnel with which he should have a comprehensive
knowledge ais! detailed understanding,

3, PRINCIPAL AGENT - Raymond H, GERENDE

a. Background + GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since
18 March » Wnich was just prior to his graduation from the Mexico
City College. He ts now only 24 years of age, but in the Station's opinion,
{s a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contract ageat, During
the three and one-half years that he has been working for the Mexico

City Statton, GERENDE has participated in a varied assortment of support
and intelligence cperations, Inirially, he was tratned and used by Matthew
S, DINGLEY as a member of the LIPSTICK survetilance team, In addition,
to surveillance work, he was used a3 an investigator to collect operational
data on persons and organizations of interest to the Station, He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was the leader of
the LIPSTICK team, He has been used as a LIFEAT Base House operator

LSTESOR aE GRRE we ERIE 3

SECRET

and processor of tapes; he has excelled tn this type of work because of
his bi-lingual Spanish/English faciizy and, more importantly, due to
his diversified cxperience in clandestine operations which permits him
to spot operational leads much more readily than the average LIFEAT
monitor,

b, Duties - GERENDE ts currently serving as the principal agem

tn charge of LIMITED, LiCALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY
Surveillance Team and LILYRIC, In addition, he monitors and processes
the BGMORNING and Cuban Exiles LIFEAT taps, He also supervises

the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (his brother-tn-law) and the
translation work of LIPSTICK~40 (nis aister), Hie maintains contac. with .
and provides afministrative support to LIMITATIONS 5 and 6, LICOOL-7
Base operators, Quite obviously GERENDE's many’ ditties overlap the
bounds of several Station operations, namely LIPSTICK, LIJERSEY,
LIFEAT, LICOOL and several activittes which are not listed under

that it {s not advisable to have one principal agent connected with as
many operations as is GERENDE. However, the present scarcity of
both staff and contract agents of the principal agent type necessitate
such efficiency measures, Every effort ts being made to compartment
the various scgments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and
to eliminate where possible, all lateral communications between
agents,

C athe - The most sertous security situation
surrounding CE = and his many activirtes {s the fact that

LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team members arrested

tn the June 1958 flap) know GERENDE by true name, and knew that he

also worked for KUBARK. In iact, LIPSTICK-30 is a close personal
friend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK
employment by GERENDE, The operational security hypothesis that

can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous

to list in this brief review; suffice to say that should GERENDE be
arrested by one of the local police agencies, most of the remaining
support assets would be destroyed or so seriously compromised that

the Statton would indeed be foolish to continue using them, It ts
appropriate to state here, however, that netther GERENDE nor the

Station believes that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise

identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap, It is granted though that

any future questions by one of the local police agencies to the compro-
mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE,
Based on the duties which GERENDE is currently performing, the readers
of this review can well imagine what the consequences to several operations

and interrogated tn detail, Also, the Station must forever be aware Uunat
the Incal police azenctes sre certainly capable, for only a few dollars, of
selling tnformarion concerning KUBARK to the Soviets and/or Satelitres,

d, Recommendations - It would be unwise to consider terminating
GERENDE since he {6 a highly competent agent and since his termination
would not eliminate the fact that he knows a great deal abou the Station's
support operations, He nas been reminded several times, and the Case
Officer will continue to remind him, that his tradecraft professionalism
must {mprove and stay ahead of the increasing sophistication of the local
police agenctes and opposition services operating in Mexico,

“~~ Je tg the’opinton of the Station that GERENDE should continue
to be uscd in about the same manner that he {a presently betng used. Ie
would be advisable, however, to EE ANINe: him, irom the. CWO 0 LIEEAT., a

ramifications, but also becauze GER ENDE does not have time to run
properly hts support mechanism and to monitor taps seven days a week,

To provide for a sttuatton whereby one of the local police
agenctes becomes aware of GERENDE's Wegal activities and assuming
that etther GERENDE or the Staticn learns of this before the local police
agency can take positive action, i ts imperative that a warning system
of communications be established to facilitate GERENDE’s removal

from Mexico, Arrangements such as those used for Wilfred O, CLOWER .

could be set up or local arrangements could be made with ODUNIT or
ODOATH for a more expeditious exit from Mexico, The Case Officer
will develop this plan in detall,

Netther GERENDE nor LIPSTICK-14 are aware that KUBARK

munications exists whereby a Station officer could contact
LIERSEY-2 directly should the need arise; however, GERENDE has
been instructed to set up such a aystem of communications, The
same wtll be done with LIERSEY-5, although he {s known to
several Station officers and little difficulty would be experienced
in contacting him directly,

(4) Security - The security of the LILYRIC Base eppears,

at least on paper, to be in better shape than the Limited or
LICALLA Bases, Insofar as the Case Officer has been able

to determine, the only indigenous agents aware of the LILYRIC
Base are GERENDE, LIJERSEYS 2, S$ and 12, and LIPSTICKS

38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connecticn
with the operation of the Base, The only tie-in the LILYRIC Base

to change his meeting plans with LJERSEY-5 andto review

curlostty that LIPSTICK-14 and LIVERSEYS-2 and 12 may have. This
procedure {s beltevext desirable due to the confining nature of the
photogrzphic tasks and the lack of additional personnel to asstst

at each of the bases, Also, this staggered schedule of coveraye
should reduce some of the duplication presently coming in from

the two bases,

LICALLA

(1) Target - Stationary photogrp hic survetJlance of persons
and activities in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation,

(Q Personnel - LIPSTICK-39, his wife and three emall childrea

ue. lve at tic LICALLA Base, He ts an accountant for a local

bus line and works at his Cover ‘fob'tn the evenings, “LIPSTICK-39 *
does an excellent and ccnsctentious job of photographic coverage

at the LICALLA Base, In addition to the photos he takes, he

writes a narrative description of the events which take place

in the target's garden areca, He receives a monthly salary of

$2, 000. 00 (MN) and free rent az the LICALLA Base,

(3) Communtcattens - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK -39 twice
weekly, Usually on Tucsdays and Thuradaysa, Thcy have four
contact points, one of which ts selected at each meeting for

use for the next meeting, In the event that contact is not
established, GERENDE has the initiative in contacting LIPSTICK-39
by phoning him at the bus line office during the evenings, Then, by
prearranged open code, a meeting site and tine are agreed on,
Since Oliver G, SCANTLING is also acquainted with LIPSTICK-39,
{t would be possible to contact him through SCANTLING should
something happen to GERENDE, Howevez, to facilitate proper

and gectire communications procedures, GERENDE has been
directed to establish a reserve’ system of communications with
Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonafides,

(9 _— Security- The most sertous security problem concerning
LICA: fact that LIPSTICK-39 ts the brother of
LIPSTICK-47 (the first agent arrested by the local police agency
during the recent LIPSTICKflap). Although it is generally

belfeved by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39's name was not
mentioned by LIPSTICK~47 nor that any indication was given
concerning LIPSTICK-39's job, tt must be understood that

should the local police agency decide later to interrogate
LIPSTICK-47, the probability exists of compromising LIPSTICK-39

. and LICALLA, The Station sees no way to overcome this

possibility.

It is {mportant to note here that LICALLA occupies one of the four
LIMUST properties, While tt ts believed that LIPSTICK-39 does
not know that KUBARK owrs the Base or has anything to do with
the other three houses, it {s entirely concefvable thar ahould one
of the local police agenctes or the LIMEAICK personnel become
aware of LICALLA acttvities, they could very eastly arrive at
some logical conclusions about all of t:z LIMUST property, This
would be detrimental, if nc: fatal, to our aims, However,
another Station viewpoint on this same problem ts that {f compromtsed,
LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than to, LIMUST,
Should one of the local police agenctes begin an investigation which
might involve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be”
sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base, These possibilitles
become somewhat theoretical and perhaps impractical due _ .

vv to the lack of predtettbility. of the-Idéal ‘polt@eagénctes, but‘neverthe= ~~

"ese must be weighed one against the other,

Leen mene eee ee nee

In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST
operation a lot of thought and discuasioa have transptrer at the
Station about ce :tinuing the LICALLA operation in its present
locatioa or suspending tt for the {mmediate future and attempting
to find another suitable locetton away from the LIMUST property,
A sound argument can be made for terminating the base since such
an alternative might have the effect cf limtring any knowledge
LIPSTICK*39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST installation,
However, the terminarton of a productive base such as LICALLA
would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could not help but
leave him a bit suspicious, For Headquarers information, the
local rental lawe are such that LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to
| comprehend why we dtd not insist on him maintaining “squatters
rights” (as stated previously, LIPSTICK-29 apparently does not

know that we own LICALLA or even have an interest tn any of the
other LIMUST properties) which can easily be done in Mexico,
Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA might cause more
of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permitting
LICALLA to operate as it {s now, Another posstbiltry would be
terminating LIPSTICK-39 and putting another agert in the present
LICALLA Base, If this measure were followed, tt would not
eliminate the fact that LIPSTICK-39, even tf terminated, would
ettll know of the existance of the present LICALLA Base, Still
another possibility would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the
LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST
properties are ostensibly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, suspictcns
end investtgations could still lead to LIMUST,

: (2) Personnel - LIPSTICK-2, as indtcated by the low numerical '
, deatgnation of his eryptonym, has been employed by KUBARK for
| geycral years, At the present time LIPSTICK-2 {s responsthle
| for the day-to~<iay operation of the photogruphic surveillance

t apartments, Jn the past, LISSTICK~-2 has served as team leader {
\ of a low level survetllance team (which was compromised and
| subsequently disbanded), as a LIFEAT ltne inspector (when he
i was not busy with the photo truck), and as a4 statt surveillance
| man (Le,, used as an ouside sentry during the March 1953
entry of the LIMUST Base by KUTUBE/D, KURIOT and KUCLUB
j technictans, (NOTE: LIPSTICK~-2 waa assigned the task of

only LIPSTICK-2, with whom he works on the photo truck, His
cover {s as a salesman of electrical appliances; however, he

does not pursue his cover job to the desirable extent, LIPSTICK-24
was recruited by LIPSTICK-2 about one year ago and ts currently
recetytag a salary of $1,000.00 (MN) per month, Since he has

now worked a year for the Station, and performed satisfactortly,
hts salary should be ratsed to $1, 200,00 (MN) per month (LIEMPTY
will provide for this increase),

(3) Communications - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK-2 two to three
tlmes'a week, These meetings are arranged by phone and take
place at previously selected contact points which can be referred
to in telephonic conversations by innocent sounding code names,
LIPSTICK~-2 also knows GERLNDE's true name, where he Ives, and
his phone number, In the past he has had occaaton to telephone
GERENDE st the latter‘ home.” LIPSTICK-2 knows DINGLEY, and
could, tn an emergency situation, contact DINGLEY, However,
GERENDE has becn instructed to arrange a complete communtica-
ttons plan with LIPSTICK-2, including a reserve means of contact,
For security reasons, GERENDE hes been instructed to inform
LIPSTICK-2 that hts only contact is with GERENDE and thar tn
the future he {s uot tocontact anyone else tn the organization
without GERENDE's permission, Also, that should contact with
GERENDE be disrupted, he ts to awatt for the higher echelon to
establish contact with him (all agents under GERENDE are being
go instructed), This ts particularly {mporiant tn the case of

tpstick-2, since he has by-passed GERENDE tn two or three

in the past,

(4) Security- Probably the most serious security situation
involving the photo truck, LIPSTICK~=2 and Lipstick-24 ig the

basic knowledge of the LIPSTICK surveillance team that such an

asset exists, even to the point that one of the team members
LIPSTICK-~34) is the listed owner of the photo truck, The personal

knowledge of LIPSTICK~2 about the LIFEAT operation also represents’

a security hazard of the first class, For example, if LIPSTICK-2
were compromised and arrested as a result of his activities,

there {s a possibility that he could compromise his brother,
LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE
and our tnterest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation,
(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former
LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have

that they were not to discuss any aspect of their operations with

have no contact with LIPSTICK-14 or any other uperational
personnel he may know except, of course, LIPSTICK-24,

with whom he works, and GEREND2£, who supervises his
activitles, In addition to the above, the Station should begin
thinking about a replacement agent for LIPSTICK-2 and every |
effort vhould be made to set up an independent and compartmented
photo truck operation, Thta‘would’permit the eventiial termination
of LIPSTICK-2, after we have given him several months to

reduce hia knowledge of current operations,

LIJERSEY

(1) Terget - Poot surveillance and investigative support of
other Sato operations,

(2) Personnel- LIJERSEY-4 ts of a low soctal class and
lives with its mother in a slum area of Mexico City. He ta

the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers

and sisters, He ts described by GERENDE as having a lot of
ambition and a strong desire to tmprove his standard of living

and position in life, The Station has found him to be a good
observer and, consequently, adequate for static surveillance
work, Although he now has his drivers Hcense, he ts not a
capable driver and probably will never develop {nto one,
GERENDE haa been encouraging LWYERSEY~4 to obtain employment
86 & salesman to supplement his KUBARK income of $1, 000,00
(MN) and to establish himself in a cover job, However, LIERSEY-4
has not yet obtained such employment, It is-the Station's

opinion that LIJERSEY-4 ts definitely an asset of limited value

and will never develop into the high-calibre surveillance asset
which the Station really needs,

LIJERSEY-8's struation ts about the same as LJERSEY-4's,

He lives with his famtly and is currently taking highschool

courses (LIJERSEY-4 is doing the same), He is not an imaginative
talker and has difficulry making up cover stories and spur-of-the-
moment excuses and explanaticns - the vital qualifications for a
good surveillance man, He ts the best driver of the three LIERSEY

team members and with more practice will probably develop
teto a capable and dependable driver, LIJEXSEY~-8 has

recently shown a commendable amount of tnirlative where his
ourer situation is concerned, He has obtained a job as a
commiscion salesman for UNVERWOOD typewriters and,
according to GERENDE, 1s making a substantial amount of "pin"
money, However, as tn the case of LERSEY-4, LIJERSEY-8
tg at best an asset of only Mimited value, LITERSEY-8 alzo
receives a salary of $1,000, 00 (MN) per month,

LIJERSEY-13 does not know LIJERSEYS<4 and 8 and vice versa,
LIERSEY-13 ts better dressed than the other two team members
and can pags as a better educated and more socially flexible __
. tndividual, He speaks fairly good Engltsh’ " He performa pretext
tnvestigation assignments with facility and imagination and is
adept at making up cover stortes, In brief, he makes a good
tmpreagion on the people he interviews, He ts not a good
driver and is too nervous to develop into one, His salary ts
$1,000, 00 (MIN) per month,

(3) Communications - GERENDE has daily contact arrange-
ments with the three LJERSEYS, Prearranged meeting places
are uged on designated days of each week and the LIERSEYS are
tnstructed to go to each meeting, They have standing instructions
to continue going to their meeting ettes for rwo weeks; if they
have not been contacted during that period of time, they can
diacontinue their communications plan and await contact by
GERENDE or another appropriately selected agent at their
respective homes, None of the LJERSEYS have home telephones;
hence, tt {s impossible to arrange any type of communications
using this means, GERENDE ts currently in the process of
setting up new and more complete communications arrangements
with the three LIJERSEYS,

(4 Security - Insofar as knowledge of other operations,
personnel aad assets is concerned, the LIJERSEYS appear to have

the best security of any of the operations handled by GERENDE,

New communications plans with the LIJERSEYS w ill co much

toward increasing security and ability to meet contingencies,
GERENDE will be instructed to give refresher training to all

three LIERSEYS in operational security, cover and communications,
The major danger existing with the LIEERSEY team, and with any |
survelllance team, is the possibility of compromise and arrest !
by one of the local police agenctes, Should this happen, GERENDE
and his other operations would be placed in considerable danger,

(5) Recommendations ~ It is suggested that the LIJERSEY
frameworx be used for the recruitment cf at least three competent

and higher class local nationals for use ca surveillance aaslgn-

ments, After the recruitment of such individuals, tr may be

suggested thar LIFERSEYS-4 and & be terminated, LIJERSEY-13 should
remain as an indcpendent tnvesilgative asset to conduct "credit"

and other type of urtes which ‘he can co without help from

other agents, LIJE: ERSEY-S has already been asked to spot

prospective candidates of a higher soclal standing for use on @

new surveillance team; however, even under optimum conditions,

one and a half years will be required to get such a team functioning,

In order to recruit the type of team member that will be most
worthwhile to the Station, we must plan to pay a mintmum starting
salary of $1, 600,00 (MN) per month, The cost of living in

Mextco ts continually on the rise and where $1,000.00 (MN)

was a good salary one to two years ago, it really is not adequate today,

LIFEAT
(ly Ta - Conversations coming from two telephone taps,
BGMO and Cuban exiles,

(Q Personne) - - GERENDE lives in the apartment where these
two lines are maintained, He personally processes the take
from the lines and it to OUSLER for Station dissemination
to Robert B, RIGGS (BGMORNING) and Cahide K, Shyrock (Cubans)?
GERENDE, tn accordance with LIFEAT procedures, is supposed to
remain in this apartment seven days a week, However, this is
impossible due to his other operational assignments and ectivirtes,

(3) Communtcastons - GERENDE meets daily with OUSLER
to pasa the LIFEAT “take” and to discuss other operational

matters,
(4 - Ir ts not a good securtry practice to have a
LIF or working on anything except LIFEAT, Other

duties, which GERENDE certainly has, limit one’s capability
for matmaining the required security alermess for telephone

through any of bis other opcrations, & {a cuncetvable that the
ESMORNENG and Cuban Extles LIFEAT taps would be discovered

of interest (o the Station and to Headquarters, seh tenes

(2 Persornel - LIMITATION-S and hia wife, LIMITATION-6, .
are the LIGU7L-7 Buse House operators, LIMITATION-5 has
been with KUBARK for sevoral years, Ho wes at one time the
LIAXIOM Base House operator, He presenily works for the

DuPont Company, He dresses well, speaks eos. English

and could be described as belonging to the rising middle class of
Mexicans, His wifs can do photographic work and has had previous
experience with KUBARK tn the dispatching of car survelllances

by radio, LIMETATIONS-5 end 6 are mt piriictpating in any
acttve work pexxling the tnstallarton of LICOOL-7 tn their apartment,
LIMUTATION-S receives a monthly salary cf $200,00 (MN) and
LIMITATION-6 receives $400. 00 (MN) monthly,

(3 Communications - A complete communications plan does
mee exist between GEXENDE and LIMITATION-S, At the present
time ft ts only necessary for GERENDE to sce LIMITATION-5

on pay day and when Harvey C. MULFORD deatres to visit the
apartment for technical surveys and other work, Therefore,
GERENDE and LIMITATION-S utilize an open code telephonic
means of getring together. So far, this has worked quite well, but
ix will be necessary later to set up & more sophisticated
communications system,

(ey + The operational aspects of LICOOL-7 are under

Also on the payroll as worthwhtle assets are GERENDE's brother-in-
law, LIPSTICK-38, and his aister, LIPSTICK-40, GERENDE end LIPSTICK-
38 process and print all the LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and truck
photos, LIPSTICK-40 does non-sensitive translation work for the Statton,
Both LIPSTICKS-38 and 40 are handled by GERENDE, They do not have
contact with other avents or with zzatloa officers, LIPSTICK-38 recetves
a moniy salary of $1,000,00 (MN), LIPSTICK-40 recetves the equtvalent
or $1,75 U. S, in pesos per hour for her work,

Although it is not adviseable from the security point of view to have any __.
indigenous agent aware of all three of our LIMERICK photographic bases and
the phoro truck, the load on the Station photographer several months ago
resulted in just such a solution to the problem, Previously, GERENDE and

LIPSTICK-38 had processed only the photographs from LIMITED, LILYRIC and

the truck,
5. RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendattons have »een tncluded in several sections of this paper,
These same recommendations, excepting those which have already been carried out
or are in the process of implementation, are listed balow in a composite form
to facilitate the readers’ overall comprehenston,

a, Conttaue the reorganization cf communtcation arrangements
with all agents,
b, Relfeve GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties (B GVORNING and Cuban

Exiles taps) as soon as possible,

C Continue to use GERENDE for the time being as the principal
agent in charge of LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA, the Photo Tnuck,
LYERSEY, LIMITATIONS-5 and 6, and LIPSTICKS 38 and 40,

a, Arrange a warning system of communications for removing
GERENDE to PSPRIME should he be compromised to one of the local
police agencies,

e Purchase a new photo truck for use by LIPSTICKS 2 and 24,

i. Begin planning for a compartmented photo truck operation
which will later permit termination of LIPSTICK~-2,

we 7 Be Spot and recruit at least three indigenous agents from the
middle class soctal level to form the nucleus of a new LHERSEY

surveillance team,

h, Eventually separate GERENDE from either LIIERSEY surveillance
team dut{es or the three photographic base houses, preferably the former,
The two types ef activities are not compatible with each other and should
not be handled by the same princtpal agent,

t, Implied, but not specifically stated elsewhere in this paper,

te the suggestion that GERENDE be gtven a "cooling off" and training

period of two to three months in PUPRIME, Of course, this will not

be possible until other assets are developed to take over GERENDE'S

present duties, After his return from PBPRIME, GERENDE could be

used to develop new support assets which would be completely compartmented
from all of his previous operations, personnel and acttvitles,

6, | CONCLUSIONS
Ie would take several weeks of uninterrupted study of files to write a
really comprehensive security review of GERENDE's operations and activities,
Huwever, besed on the facts contained in this paper, I! ts the Station's opinion
that GERENDE probably ta not now known to the local police agencics es a
KUBARK or FRPRIME agent, It is believed that GERENDE could be tdenrified
by the local police agencies at any time they choose to interrogate LIPSTICKS=12
aad 30 tn detail or when one of the other agent assets formerly or currently
@geoctated wit: GERENDE ts compromised, Furthermore, if GERENDE ta
arrested, he could compromise most of the Station's support assets, plus the
BGMORNING and Cuban Exiles portions of LIFEAT,

Givea several months time, the slow process of compartmentation
can be introduced into GERENDE's operations, Such compartmentation, however,
wlll never reach the truly desirable point, bur some tmprovement over the :
existing situation can be made, If GERENDE can emerge basically unscathed
from the current incidents, then KUBARK will have an extremely valuable : .

long-range support asset.

MEMORANDUM FOR: WH/III/Mexico
SUBJECT: Paymond H. GEZENDE
REFEHEECEs HA-11368

1, This dispatch represents the type of operational reporting
we nood, I think any answer to the Station should lead off with an
expression of appreciation for’@ good Job. | Maybe it wil)” encourage’ “?™
thea to write more of this type.

sce: GERENDE is. very exposed, and. should be taken off sone of his eiteg.ee eines
jobs at once, Specifically, my ideas are as follows:

3. Re para. 3 a, agent is very capable and should be retained
if secure means can be found, Getting rid of hin would not solve the
Problea, As long as he is in Mexico he is vulnerable. Some thought
should te given to how he would be supported in the event of arrest.
Personally, I believe the Station would do better to sacrifice a case .
officer than penmit things to crag on to the point where GERENDE might
tell all to the police,

Recommendations: ‘

&, OERENDE be briefed so as to be ever reacy with an innocuous
story to tell the police in the event of arrest,

b. GERBNDE be told to contact one of already blown Station
officers like EAZLETT in the event of arrest ond that the Station
officer be ready to appear personally at police station to free
GEPENDE. If the case officer naned for this e¢:ty and GERSNDE
both know the innocuous cover story, there should be little probles,
I have done it myself. A good cover story is "looking for draft
dodgers" or some such tale which does not have implications of i
Working against Mexican citizens, . .

¢. That if not allowed to communicate directly GERENDE should :
tell the senior officer present at police station that he vorks
on (cover story) for HAZLTT and insists HALLETT be sent for,

da. That a second blown case officer's nane be given as an
alternate for HAZLETT, who is often out of toun and unavailable.

@. That GERENDE be taken off LIFZAT at once and all
suspicious audio equipment be removed from his home or offices.
At present, LIFZAT is the cnly illegal activity being engaged
in by GERENDE; if he is made merely in connection with his
physical surveillance activities he is not likely to be hurt
by the Mexicans,

f. Concur preparations should be made to hide out GEREXDE
if it is known he is to be arrested.

4. Re para. 4 a, GERENDE's participation in LIMITED is 0. K,
I believe no law is being broken, However, LIMITED is probably blown
to the Soviets, Hewis the more real danger, Station should find out
who is the registered owner of the phone at LIMITED. Prior to leaving
Mexico I noted to MAHONEY it was still held in the name of LIES TONE=3
(now fired and hence a possible threat).

5. Re para, 4 bs: ‘This is the same situation as LIMITED but not
80 likely blewm to the Soviets, There is no reason why GERENDZ should
not continue this work,

6. Re para.  ¢, LICALLA is a very special problem and should
be taken up at once with Headquarters elements working on LIMESA/LIMUIST.
I thought LICALLA had been cancelled out when LDGSA began to shape ups
I consider it a danger to LIMESA, Has LICALLA produced anything of
value? I think we could vacate this in such a way that the agents in
LICALIA would have no cause to be suspicious, (Put an obvious tail on
the agent, scare him off, ete, This would throw off the Mexican police,
too, in the event they are alresdy Wise to LICALLA through LIPSTICK h7.
We could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tail and the. gane is up.)

Racosmendation: Get rid of LICALLA unless very productive. Better
do this before the remodeling begins,

7. Re para h d, photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 does know of the locations
of same of the baschouges on LIFEAT since he was a line inspector,

Recosmendations:

a. New compartmented truck should be set up. Don't use false
names and addresses. It could result in great harm,

b. LIPSTICK-2 be sent off to some small town as "resident
. agent® for general work and to get him ont of the area,

8. Re para, «, Ihave no particclar thoughts on LIJERSYY bet
think it consistent for GERENDE to hardle it,

: 9. Be para.  f: GZRENDE should be taxen off LIFZiT at once,
even if it means losing lines, As of March this year the Station
had enough agent persormel to handle bases for 24 lines, They should
be able to fill the gap even though LIMESTON=.3 and his tribe were
fired, Only 12 lires are nw being handled (latest resort). ‘The way

' CERENDE is handling his LIFEAT work seens to Le breacing all the rules

wo set up inssven years of experience,

lo. Be para. 4 & LICOOL-7;;"" I see no harm in GER2WEts paniling

i the operational aspect of this case, But thro:sh PROParIenes the
police could get bace to LIMITATICN and the main LIGICY tap, that is,
if thoy were able to make GERENDE talk. before. we- -eoela-eave. hing The

t sees > 2 danger to LIMITATION was not brought < out ia the Station's survey.

12, In re para, 5, recommendations -
a. Approve,
b. Set hin off LIFEAT right now,
e. Concur, but liquidate LICALLA,

| d. This needs some discussion, What do we do with GEREXDE
: in the U. S.?

e, Concur,

‘ f. Concur with reservation noted above.

|
i
|

eg. OK.

h. I don't see why he can't handle ali these jobs since
they are physical surveillances,

4, Not a dad idea.
12, Final observations: '
a. What is GSRENBE's cover?

be We mst be sure he is not overworked. Slocpy work has
resulted from people being overworked,

suByscT: Evaluation of trainee in Special Project LIPSTICK

: 1. Instruction is this project comnenced 10 June and was

concluded 12 July 1957. It covered tradecraft, observation,

i description, casing amt reporting, principles of CE’I, elicitation
and interviewing, investizative techniques, and TSS briefings in

2. Trainee was mow as "Ray". He was easy to work with.
So was always pleasant, courteous, cheerful and eesemed genuinely | seer ae Ppevesced
interested in every passe of the training. ».Re..can-spesk;” read and meres
write English without ‘my difficulty.

3. Ray seemed well motivated; more Pro-American than Mexican.
Se posseses a strong izterest in clandestine work. He is an avid
reader. He demonstrated ability to apply principles he had leamed
from reading and study. He seemed possessed of initiativa although
there was a limited opportunity of observing this quality in action.

. lu. While Ray's duties to date apparently have not given him a
i wide and varied experience in clandestine activity, he seemed to

} grasp the material quite readily; and although in the field of

: CI“CE he scated he had never thought of many of their aspects as

: applying to hin, he seened glad of the opportunity to leam and

, absorbed then quite reatily. He now possesses a good working
knowledge of fundamental principles involved. However, it is felt
that if he is to work primarily in this field, it should te under
the supervision of a case officer with considerable experience and
H background in this type of activity.

' S. As previously indicated, Ray was an avid reader. In addi-
i tion to certain case studies, be read the following books:

"Handbook for Spies*

“The Spy web"

“Out of Bondage"

"London Calling North Pole®
"A Spy Has No Friends"

6 It is felt that Pay benefitted considerably from this
course of instruction. We feel that his concept and understand=
ing of principles of clandestine activity have been broadened
and strengthened. His interest, enthusiasm and production should
reflect this in his future work.
