: Attached is a drsrt of an azendvent on TICHsGEN.
Note xeqo of rearest asks for an increase in basic
fee fron $12,000 to $17,000. based on TICH?OPN's
“overall nerfornance and full tine services". Gale

_ additional menoranda in file reflect the
following:

: (1) 15 May 1961 contract (stil1 in effect) provided
ra a basic fea of $8000 with no mention of easunt
of tine gubject worked to earn suche

(2) Wi memo of 13 June 63 asked a pay incraase from
S000 to $5000 based upon, "manner of TICHECPN's
performance and the increase ant. of time which

he devotes to Agency requirements".

(3) aH dispatch of 9 Nov 64 said that, "Hqs ogrees
that present expiring contract called for about
2/ards subject's time-<-TiCH20HN pointed out....
he now engaged 90% of his time for Agency". °

(4) WH memo of 2h Nov 6h requested an increase from
* $9000 to $12,000 based upon TICHSORN's increased
value plus "using TICHHOMi's service on
&: sbstantially a full time basis",

(5) AS cited above, current WH memo of 7 Oct 66 asks
for an increase cf $84 from $12,000 to 317,000
based on subject's "overall performance and full .

tine services",

Dear Mr. gaaceun :

Reference ja rnade tu your current contract ‘vith the United States
Government, a9 reyresented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been rcently completed allowing certain
. Independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security vot
. credita by covering such individuals under the social security tax i
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include '
‘a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the : }
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since i
. . é
{

A we

the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
- self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
“ of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4h and 3-5/8% respectively.

Ao a consequence thereof, exid contract is amended by deleting .
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph: |

iad . "Effective I December 1964, social pecurity taxes will be covertly ‘
if - deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same —~ 4
manner and to the same extent as vould be done If you were a Govern- . 4
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necesagary. Its ‘
implementation doee not imply in any manner the actual creation of an- _ 4
“ employee-employer relationship, Your legal etatas under this agree- 3
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor." = \

-
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security.
credits from overt svurces you will so notify this organization and an
adjustmant will be made or covert deductiona discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, Uf you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this

organisation. In such’ event your covert credits will be erased and your

covert deductions retarned.

All other terme and conditions of said contract remain in full force
and effect. .
