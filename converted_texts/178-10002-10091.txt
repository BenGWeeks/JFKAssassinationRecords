Q And Mr. Fitzgerald?
A Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other
people. We were -- we nad just moved the Station at that time,

in Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace

and we felt that it was probably bugged, so all conversations

took place -- we walked around the garden and tyat type of

A Yes.

Q I see. |
Mr. Sanchez -- was he a member of the military?

Sanchez was.,in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military+;type.
Q Was it your understanding that the Agency had received
instructions with respect to this activity from another
component of the Government?
A Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. [ have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

And at this time vou have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was

A I can't speak to that but the records

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

But as far as sabotaging any Cuban product, no, we

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained |
unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn

Q And this particular Station, then, was under the
supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

Q When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume
responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the
Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western
Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Q Is there presently a Miami Station?

A Oh, yes.

Q And how large is it at the present time?

A Well, since we ~~ I think when we closed down the
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present
time because we are in one of these periods. where: we -are
reassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year
therevare going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time <=: collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this
type of thing. Covert action.

Q This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

A Well, the collection of foreign positive and probably
counterintelligance.

Q So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence
activities in the Miami area?

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-
intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting
in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

number of other people. When she hit the -~ they had a recep-
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under Immigration

and\Naturalization Service cover. When the HEW people did the
preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill

out forms, where. were you born, this type of thing, bicegraphic+

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages: and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillante
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was cen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in. |

Q Were there many activities: of that type?

A Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some~
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from. --'
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?

A ‘Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section i
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that had gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.

MR.MANFREDI: We will reconvene at 1:00 o'clock.

Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot
down some additional requirements and.ask that that person be

A CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

0. What Agency is charged with that responsibility?
A. Health, Education and Welfare.

0, Noes CIA play any role in that process?

A We mav assist if we are.asked but the idea of the whole

airlift was having relatives here. for somebodv to claim you when
you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when these refugees came.in, they were

with that whatsoever.

A. SASER, Latin American Social and Economic Research.

0. We can call them LASER for short? |

A. Really, they are both «= the onlv reason we separated

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed j

that is why wetook the smaller establishment to preserve some |

in?

A WELL, the larger group was engaged in the collection
of intelligence. They compiled dossiers on the principals
inside Cuba. They carded -- they kept card files on every
refugee that came through the reception center. They provided ~-
they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a
monthly newsletter based on the information they collected.

them were really destroyed. It got to be rather comic. We
went down there several years ago just looking through the files
to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great
information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a
gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won
a swimming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those
files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't
have any pertinancy at all.
