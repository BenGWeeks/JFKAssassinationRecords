his day to day activities and contacts. Following AMSTRUT-2's recru itment,
LIFEAT gave an excellent account of AMSTRUT-2's activities for those perio
he was not under the control of his case officers, This was invaluable proof
of his full cooperation with KUBARK and added a Safety factor for the case
officers making ithe recruitment and initial handling which would not have been

hampered much of the LIFZAT work, principally because many of the lines

During the early part of August 1962 a group of ' “coyotes” was uncovered
in the telephone company in Mexico City and a number of arrests were made,
This group had organized a unit including linemen, centralmen, installation _
crew, Warehousemen, and workers In the office responsible for providing ser-
vice to new clients, It was the-purpose of the "coyote”.group to provide service,
fora price, to those individucts whose requests for ins:allations had been turned
down by che telephone company due to limited availability of cables and contacts,
(Note: 2 company generally keeps a certain number of "spare pairs” in each
cable for its own use in providing special service, company phones, and for re-
routing during repairs co other cubles, It was these spare pairs and contacts
which the “coyotes” used to provide illegal phone service.) This telephone com-
pany within the telephone company would also collect monthly fees from their
“subscrifers", When the story came out, ihe telephone cunmipany had special

‘police siationed in each central and spot checks made of linemen and crews to -
preven: recurrence, [t was thereiore necessary for the LIFEAT linemen to
refrain from any clandestine activity for a period of almios: four weeks so as
not to be accidentally picked up as a member of the “coyote” group, LIFEUD-1
has reported ihat ihe situation is now back to uormal with the special police
detaits and special checkups terminated, No compromise of ihe LIFEAT oper

The basehouse operators for LIFEAT Annex Vi, LIFEUD-S and LIFEUD- 1
after.a long period uf family disagreemcuts, have tnutually decided on a
divorce, Both are being terminated by KUBARK since their usefulness as
basehouse keepers for the project will end with their divorce, The agents have
agreed to the termination and it-will be accomplished ou a friendly basis,
(Ageut Service Records will be forwarded), Therefore, it has been necessary
to close Annex VI and terminate coverage of the lines provided by that base-
house, LIFEUD-24 and LIFEUD-26 have been recruited to replace the ter-
minated couple and are-presently looking for a suitable basehouse which could
fully replace ihe uld Annex VI.. (Note: POA was granted for LIFEUD-24 on 28
June 1962. and OA was requested, “Also, OA was requested for LIFEUD- 26

on 30 August 1962.)

No change,

D, Security

No security incidents directly affecting the operation or future of
LIFEAT were noted ducing July 1962. The assignment of special telephone
company crews to make a survey of spare telephone Lines available for
use of new subscribers may cause problems when these crews uncover a
“spare” tine used‘in a LIFEAT coverage, However, sincé these crews
have no auchority (or dcstre) to’trace down the lines to thelr ultimate
destination, normal ELIFEAT security pracilces should negate this danger,

j | A second development which could cause future problems is the possible
assignment ofa LIENVOY technician co check telephone ceatrals to sze
exactly who else may be carrying on LIENVOY iype work, -As of this date
LIFEAT persomel, who have heen provided with the crue name of this
individual, have never heard of him working in any central in Mexico City,
As of this moment it appears ‘this will not develop into a thréat to ‘
LLUFEAT operations, . : : oe

E. Technical

New recorders provided in May.to LIFEAT are now in operation and
appear superior to previous models used, It is planned, with the approval
of Project LUFEAT for FY 1963, to completely re-equip LIFEAT with new

As a continulay asect, LIFEAT ‘provided daily netice: ‘of -
the activities and movements of Polish officiais. In cne case
LIFFAT provided advance informaticnh cenecrning travel plans of
sone Jan, KRZYAICEL, ‘a person or, the Polish Watch ‘Tet. ?

(3) During tne reporting period LIFEAT added to the security

of the Station in checking on rresent and past apent assets. Of.
particular note was ‘the coveraje of the activities. cf LIFIRE, _-

“ ( LIVESTOCKeL, and LIVESTOCK <2.

{k) Until terminated for scourity reasons (see SEC-RITY, :
below), LISTAT onveraze of the I'A.R. Fabassy provided inderendent
> _ check of the activitles nf the manbers of that inrtallation. Of
nots were the LIFTAT revealed mectings between Vicente LOMBARDO ©
Toleduno, former Mexican President Lazaro CARDINAS and‘ the previous:

‘teAe2e Ambassador Anouar NATH. This coveraze also provided infor=’
; mation ecne.-rning the vielt of an Algerian retel delegation to
= Bexicos :

(5) LIFEAT provided coverage of the local Comzunists, the
“Amorican Communist Group in Mexico (AQJM}, and lately on two
inportant Canadian Communists ving in Mexico. In ita coverage

of lecal Conminists LIF=AT provided coveraje of Carmen [RUFAU
Civit (admitted former Sovict a.eat), Xavier CUE‘RIRD Saucedo
and hie wife, Clara Porcet de CUEUVERO, and Juan Lais CA“POS
yillalotos. LIFEAT provided leads indicated the place of enploy=_
“ment of BRUFAU, as well as much of her dally routine, thereby

allowing the Station to initiate rhysical survcillance of her.
LIFEAT coverage of CA!POS, of interest to the Station's Communist
Party Penetration Progran, revealed his insincerity in cooperating
with KUUARK, and as a refult efforts toward his full recruitment
weve terminated with minimin danger to Station assets. Recently,
at Headquarters request, LIF/AT reinitiated its coverage of the
GUERREHOS. This coverage has already provided information of the.

continuing contact between the SUERHEOS and Frank and Libby z,
‘PARK, Canadian Communist "inmisrantes" to Mexico and members of ag
the Lator Prozresatva Party (Canadian cP). The Station hopes to. Se

mount a more com:rehensive coverage of the PARKS as a result of ©
the LIZFAT lead, In the LIFSAT coverage of the ACH, of parti-
cular interest was the advance travel plans of Albert MALTZ, Noah
and Anna SFS0PER (as well as the travels of their scns Carl and ©
Robert, SFBORERN), Marta and Mos WICHKY, and Grace and Sam NOVICK,
Dally activitien of the ACM are provided through LIFEAT to the
local office of ODFNVY. -

_ (6) The IIFFAT complex provided the secmrity check of the
private office telephon:s of the Chief of Station and Deputy
Chief of Stution, as well as checks of the home televhones of :
certain of the Station officers (as recorted ia IMSU-16L65).
Since this service is unique and of value to Station sserity,
it will be utilized perisdically to umd against hostile audio
surveillance. .

matey:

* On 21 June 1960 LITENSOR suggested to OOS that LIENVOY
begin operations against the Soviet-and Satellite targets in Mexico City. In
order not to indicate that the unilateral LIFEAT operation was providing this
coverage, it was necessary for COS to agree to this suggestion, So a3 not to
Jeapordize LIFEAT operations and personnel, LIFEAT coverage was suspended
on the Soviet Embassy and Polish Legation, and the applicable “crogsea”" were
pulled and cleaned, This was accomplished by 1030 on 22 fune 1960, Coverage
continued:on the home of Aleksandr BEKIER, Pollsh Conselor of Legation, since
no security problem seemed to be raised by continued coverage of this line.

REF: HA(MA-15170, RYRAT-1402

” On-the evening of LS June COS met with LITENSGR at the home at LTELEGANT
(see MEXI-5761), Among other subjects discussed, LITENSOR urgently
suggestod thar OGS arrange coverage of the Soviet/ateliza installations,

Since this coverage lu obviously one of great interest to KUBARK, COS wae

left with no alternative bur to cuthuslistically accept LITENSO's suggestion,
LIELEGANT was equally enthislastle about the suggestion and requesied COS

‘to furnish a lst of target nes as coon as possible. On 21 June Malcolm QQ. _
EDELAND passed to LIENVOY/2 a ILst of 4 Soviet, 2 Polisi, 2 Czech and 2 Yugo-
slav lines. The Polish, the Czech, Yugoslav and! Soviet line were placed witiln
two days. Meanwhile-all LIFEAT Sovict/Satellte Ines were removed, After
due consideration it was decided to advise LIENVOY/2 that we would prefer to
drop the 2 Polish Mags and ut least one Yugoslav Ine ond use all remalalog
avatlable lincs (LIENVOY can handle a maximum of 30 Usce, always keeping

‘two spares) to cover a total of five Sovict Ines and keeplag the two Czech [pea
already ia operation. This was agreed to but the four additional Sovlert lines
could nat be placed immediately dug to the temporary absence from the city of
LIENVOY/3 whose aid was needed to fulflll tila assignment,

The eventuality of a request from high Mexican officials for LIENVOY coverage
of Soviet/Satellire with tra attendant affect upon LIFE’ T had been forescen by
the Station for sometime. On at least two previous occasions when a hint wag
made to OOS by lesser officials than LITENSO2, COS waa able to discuade
these officlals on the basis of lack of qualified personnel for processing, transa-
ertbing, and exploking the take that would come from taps against Sovtet/ .
Satellte installations, However, an the above occasica when LETENSOR evea
went so far.as to suggest that the translations could be haadled by language
experts st Headquarters COS wa: in no pasition to argue this polit with.
LIFENSOR. ‘The uctual.Impremeuntation of the change over of Sovier/Satellite
coverage from LIFEAT to LEENVOY (LIFEAT went back on Polish Legatton in
late June) waa accomplished smoothly, with no flapa and the Station does not en-

visien any prodlems, certainly, in the Immediate haure..

The processtag and transertbing ts belng handled in exactly ti same fashlon as
' before t.e., LIENVOY Is doing the taps only, LIFEAT persounel are processing
the tapes from LUENVOY. Ag far as die Mexicans are concerned, the tapes are
belng forwarded to iieadquarters for processtug with the transcriptions being
- gent back to the Station for our information.. The Station bas promlsed
LIENVCY/2 and LIELEGANT a monthly summary of auy isterveting alghlights
that appear tn these cranscriptions, - , ,

accomplished by associates of the American Communist Group ia Mexico (ACGM)
particularly that of Maria WICHER to Moscow, the return of Alber: MALTZ to
Mexico, and the planned travel of Noah SEBORER to Moscow In August,

b, Processing of Mati Material

During the month of May 1960, the quantity of raw informacton
. processed was noticeably reduced, and thus the amount of positive intelligence
derived was also reduced, due ro the “outage” on certaia of che most producr Wve
LIFEAT lines; Principally Involved were the Sovtet lines, including one week
break on aa Embassy line, three weeks on the Soviet Motion Picture Office line,
and one week on the Soviet Commercial Office liac, ‘These "outages" were
pr imarily due to the telephoae company pulling: the LIFEAT crosses, or the
target telephone deiag out of order,

c. Liaison

‘As in the past, the only Haison connected with Project LIFEAT is
‘in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists. in Mexico to”

MENORANILN! FOR: C/W4/3/Mextco
SUBJECT? LIFEAT

1 During my recent visit te weitco I hada geod chance to go
over many of the ins-and-outs of this project with the Case Officer
and with other officers in the Station. At Station staff.meeting I ,.
stated that reporting on CI uaterial derived from thu project was .
inadequate and COS appeared to so along with this view. The concensus
I got fram the Case Officers was that the 52 Case Officer is not
sufficiently alert to the need for reporting on the CI aspects of
the matter and is limiting hinself to strictly servicing SR. Division
matturs, Various Case Officers cited instances to me of conversations
pointing to new clandestine relationships or containing previously
known clandestine relationships in the Soviet field which have not
been reported. © Owing to a lack of time, I was unabla to examine the
records myself, but I am inclined to accept those statements as true,

2. The Case Officer gave ne a general run-down of the situation
of the agents on this project ani it appears that everything is running
‘Ho told me that in Nis new project outline, which will
be up. in a week or two, he is including some raises to some of the
agents, He told me that on his iast round of pay raises he had sane
difficulty hero at headquarters. If any difficulty scens forthcoming
this time, I should like to have the matter brought to my attention
‘because, as you know, I feel very strongly on this matter and fought
the sato battlos. with heagquar ters for at least five years,

‘3. In speaking with the Case Officers on thé Cuban side, as well
as on the CI, it was apparent that LIFFAT remains probably the bigzest
single source of information available to the Mexico Clty Station
and that every effort should be nace to continue its smooth functioning,
If this means .a couple of hundred pesos increase to each agent semi-annually
or annually, it does not seem ta te too much of a strain and T do act
see why we should have any troutie. When I compare the salaries of
the base operators and processers cn this project, especially consicering
the illezal position they are in, with those of relatively unproductive
agents elsewhere in Yexico and in sany other Stations, I cannot help
but feel that we are buying a creat deal for our money in this project.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD =
SUBJECT: DESRIEFING OF LATID M. WILSTED (ps)

1. On ‘2D June 1960 Mr. John 3. Heyn and Mr. John Kennedy of WHD,

Mr. Robert Brown of CI/OPS, “r. Robert Bryant of PI/OPS and Mr. Charles

Bray of. FI/D met with Navid ¥M. WILSTED (ps),

2. WILSTED emphasize4 that the whole telephone system in Mexico
City is undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos da Mexico, S.A.,
has sub-contracted this work of. cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
system-to the indepandent ‘firm, Intel, They are cleaning up unused and .
old lines, putting in new az2 Spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying underground cables » etc. Eventually we should be botter off da-
cause there should be, more surplus lines, Tha. renovation work has.
hampered much’ of the LIFZAT work, principally because many of the lines
now .are underground and we cannot get access to them beforo they enter
tho central. This is particularly true with respect to the Czech Eme
bassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
point we now occupy, : uo.

3. WILSTED ssid that w try to keep track of the activities of

"Intel" but since they seex to attack "Colonias” at random, we hava no

prior warming of thei prasence in a ccrtain areds

he In the recent past, “sxico hes been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. - de have more control over the access of

* phone company inspectors or repairman’ to houses. However, under new

regulations, all new aparterect Sulldings must have telephono lines ine
stalled ‘in ‘the ‘building by tae phong company during the construction

phaso, This means that tne lines’ and ‘their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again uso apartments since

we con siphon off a line dastined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone Company carmot trace its destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then jistall a soparate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subsertter' to this, line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber,: i : .

5. -One system which has been usad effectivaly is to take ons-half

" of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two half -

pairs then form one geod pair which We can use,
6— WIISTESD explainad that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a

” regular telephone. This entsila the purchase of a telephone company

bond, which later can be sold.

Exploitation. of L ads *

: " Thi: LIMERICK ‘phase of the LIFEAT operation is able
continuously to provide the interested case officers with background personality
information on the members of th vier Embassy staff, as well as travel infor-

-imation on Sovier officials and diplomatic courlers, During the month of April

1960, this type of information was exploited for the following:

-a) Viktor Nikolayevich GLOTOV, First Secretary,
will be the replacement for Viladimtr Geargiyevich NOVIKOV
as Cultural Officer when the latter leaves for the USSR on ~
29 May 1960. He will also act as the Soviet Ambassador's
executive Secretary, during the home leave of Vladimir Ivan-
.ovich CHERNYSHEV, CHERNYSHEV departed for leave °

“7 Aprile . / L

b) Nikolai ZHOUGANOV was the replacement fox’!
-Anatolly Konstaitinovich YEMELYANOV, Commercial |;
Offtce employee who works “upstairs” {n the Chancellery.
rather than in the Commercial Office, ‘This indicated
‘that ZHOUGANOV may bea code clerk, |

c) Confirmation that four’ alfens are ap a in the
Chancery, as teachers, one of whom teaches English,

d) Indications uf increased contact between the Soviet
and Cuban officials as noted in the travel of Soviet officers
to Havana and conversations berween the Cuban Embassy +
and the Soviet Ambassador indicating an announcement of

* importance was to. be made on 8 May, possibly concerning.
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba:
aid the USSR,

e) Through the review of past LIFEAT traffic and
the direct statements of the Soviet Embassy personnel in
discussions of "duty rosters", it has been determined that :
a reduction in the Embassy staff is in progress. Future) | *
LIFEAT information should disclose whether this reduction
ts of a permanent or temporary nature. Done

NOVIKOV, Semcon FEDOROV, and couriers Y ladimir BYKOV

“shipments of Russfan form tractors for which DESWAAN has received pavinient
from the Mexican Government, the ultimate purchaser, LIFEAT indicates
DESWAAN has made himself unavailable to the Soviets since two of his checks
have “bounced” for lacks of funds. LIFEAT further noted that the Soviets are
concerned over reports that DESWAAN ts planning an carly summer trip to
Europe with’his entire family, . ;

operation ly furnishing detailed tnformation,on the DeSwuan and Esteve Brothers
‘commercial dealings with the Soviets, It was.also employed, as a security device
after the conclusion of the above operation: |. oe

at we : ‘Leads were provided on two properties of Interest to the Soviets, -
Calle Mazatlan #208 and Calle Chilpancingo #13, which were a valuable contribution
to'the LIMESA Project, . LO

tl) “LEFEAT/LITMUS was the source of information on the arrival in

_ and departure from Mexico City of Polish officials Jozef WINEWICZ, former
Polish Ambassador to Washington, and Boleslaw JELEN,

: {I)-  LIFEAT/LUERODE continued to provide excellent operational
leads concerning Cuban-and exile operations, Of particular note was the ability
of Station Mexico to warn an ODACID officer of a possible "walk-in" provocation
attempt by an agent of the Cuban Embassy, LIERODE also provided informatton
on four American-citizens who entered Mexico on their way to Honduras to join

- an anti-Somoza revolutionary attempt.

b, Processing of Material

Although the LIFEAT project must be considered primarily a
_Station support project, an effort to further exploit LIFEAT for positive
intelligence has been made by assigning the assistant case officer the task of
coordinating the efforts of the appropriate area case officers and the Station
reports officer in matters concerning LIFEAT produced tnformation, Although

+. this system has been tested only during the month of Apru, it is hoped that it

will prove of value in increasing the Positive Intelligence take from LIFEAT
Provided material, .

No change was made in the manner of processing the raw LIFEAT
reels during the month of April, .

c. Liaison
5

: As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT
is in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists in Mexico te
OGDENVY for their processing, No other liaison is considered necessary or

desireable, .
d, Security. .
