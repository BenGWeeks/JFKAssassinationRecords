Ministry of Foreign Trade. He recently wrote a report on
Latin America based upon material contained in the South

out with his superiors in the Foreign Ministry, hence the
transfer.

‘The Station copies of the original, reports on SZULC have

been destroyed. _t attach, however, Pa memorandum consisting of

. selected entries from his card,

2... ‘ALL the information is from the same source, a Polish nh emmigre |

“who knew SZULC personally and. also had. informants - in the Polish Embassy. .
3. ' ‘There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-comounist at the time,

and that he co-operated with Tgnacy SACHS, @ cousin who was employed

by the Press Section: of . the Polish Enbassy, and provided him with
"information", , It would, however » be unwise. to jump to the conclusion.
that: this collaboration took the fora of éspionage, since SZULCe does
not seem to shave made any secret of the relationship.

I ean find no evidence that Tgnacy SACHS was an intelligence:

; officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist, He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs,
