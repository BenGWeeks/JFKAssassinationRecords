MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT : Compromise of Cover _ :
cet . c

1. As a result of information obtained from reliable
sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that
the former Staff personnel] listed on the attachment should
be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employces to
the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975.
We presume also that the identifications of these individ-
uals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese

to the Soviets.

. 2. Although the personnel listed in the attachment

are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest
that their official personnel records should be documented
concerning possible past compromise of their cover.

3. Ple e coordinate any action connected with this
memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMG; and Chief, CI

Staff.

Remarkas
Luke Conein has applied for employmeng
with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The
Acting D/Pers asked for the attached info
from CIA.

Sent to D/Pers for signature. Conein
was very controversial, much in the news
about the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem and
has been mentioned by Howard Hunt in Hunt'g
recent hearing before "Watergate" committed.
Dick Biladeau, Central Cover, affirms that
Conein is "opened up".

Ben -
' Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug cuordinators

with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon, DEA had requested a memo

verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E, Conein, whose name has

appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached

memorandum is what Archenhold wants.

‘Conein's service was verified with ROB; his “honorable service"
was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-
cussed the cace with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had
opened up Conein last year and Biladean approved release of the
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart-

ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being
considered as a consultant for BNDD. .

Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA,

Subject is a virtual walking oncylupedia on ‘the, history, customs
and senior personalities of Vietnam, Ho has been assoodated with this
grea on and off over tho period of the last 19 years, During this ,
tine he has developed lasting friendships with many individuals who
are now in high positions of power within the government, These
contacts are of considerable importance to the Station in its intelli-

tional activities on a discreet basis with these high personalities,
At the personal request of the Prime Minister ho has bocome senior
advisor to the Prime Minister's personal protection force and’ has,

in fact, formed and trained this force from scratch. He is a highly
motivated and dedicated officer to whom considerations of personal
convenience and safety aro always socond to his determination to ~
achievo whatever mission is given to him,

. On the negative side, his written and oral presentation, while
showing some improvement over the previous report, still needs
. additional improvement. Ho has- no supervisory responsibllities at

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services Personnel Division

ATTENTION - : Agent Panel

SUBJECT “: Deletion of ‘Arthur R, SCHWICKRATH from
: Project IUJEWEL roster.

1. Arthur R, SCHWICKRATH has been employed as a Career
Agent in Project IUJEWEL since 16 October 1961, During that
period he was assigned to the Saigon Station as a Staff
Advisor on Paramititary matters to the Chief of Station.

. 2. When at the termination of that assignment,
SCHWICKRATH returned to Headquarters, it was assumed by SOD
that he would return to SOD and be again covered by Project
IUJEWEL, However, I now understand that SCHWICKRATH is being
processed for an assignment in WH Division and is, in fact,
engaged in languago training for that assignment,

3. In view of the foregoing, it 13 vequested that the
name of Arthuc R, SCHWICKRATH be removed from the Project

IUJEWEL personnel assets.

SUBJECT: Promotion -
REFERENCE: | Fitness Report dated 25 Feb. 1963

1, In view of present and past Fitness Reports, aad
by. comparison with other ZRIEWEL personnel, I believe thet
‘the promotion of GIBB vo GS-14 equivalent: ip Justified,
and that it would be in order to convey this view to
FE/Personne). Technically, ver, the administration of
(and decision to, promote) is a responsibility of
FE Division until roverts to SOD under ZRIEWEL.

2. I would strongly recommend against any move to
request Aray to advance GSRG5D's retired status {roe
Lt. Col, to Col.e although, for operational purposes’ while
he is st Ssigoo ft might be possible to give him notional
or “assimilated” rank.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FE Division

SUBJECT: Employment of Lou Conein -

1. At my request, General Lansdale has quictly checked
on the status of Lou Concin's retirement from the Army. He is |
presently in Iran aad is slated for return héme and retirement in

‘ August. He haa made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian. wil.
Government protested that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently, . oe
he is doing a good job with them). .

a AOR Hrs eNO E ESMORIM MERRIE A ee

2. At the moment, Conein belongs to ACSI and Lansdale
feels that any move on our part to accelerate hia return would be
misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted,
by ACSI, lam getting his addross and will establish contact-with |
him by personal letter, Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious

to come back to work for the Agency,

an unheard-of thing. As you are aware, an in the case of French service
officers assigned to the to the TUTOR ORG, so are selected military
personnel assigned to KUBARK. Very recently two seafor ODIBEX officers
on the KUHOCK Senior Staff were released at ODIBEX request by KUBARK

and subsequently transferred to ODIOWN, Thailand, with no further KUBARK

connection. :

In spite of sincere protestations and denials on your part, we realize
of course that at least some bit of suspicion will linger on in TUTOR's
mind and that these suspiciona will not be allayed ty even the most
circumspect of routine contacts between persons in VILLIER's group and
members of the SIM Staff. Such contacts are bound to occur, particularly
if the VILLIERS group dees indeed succeed in getting an HIARCADE program
of any sort in motion. However, as we have stated, thiga fa an accepted
jisk, and we have to play the gume out, even thous We cannol assess

the possible damage to the SIM liaison. .

signed a statement of F eavogory to this effect oa 1 Lecem=
ver 1953.

This decision fa tn no way a reflection on you or
members of your staff but rather recognition that I cannot -

“afford to civillanice due to my personal obligations, I

Antend to inform John itichardgon of my action at the sane
time you receive this lettor.

Since T an at present holding a slot, I think it 1a
only fair to-all concerned to have it filled by a qualified
pereon before my departurn.

I want to thank you and Gordon for tho trust you have

“given: me in the past. You way reat assured that I will
