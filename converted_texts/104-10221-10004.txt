Ingeborg Diener de RICO Galan, Subject'sa wifo, traveléd from Mexico to
Cuba in November 1962, Subject was at that time in Cuba.

PASSPORT: Subject formerly carried Mexican passport mmber 57115, with
Caban courtesy visas. On 9 Septeubar 1963 Subject was issued Hexican

- paseport muaber 56341 (er 5361).

ACTIVITIES: The reason for the October 1962 trip to Cubs waa ostenaib:
Lv) gather material for a politics? blography of Fidel Castro. The May,
Jana 1963 trip was te interview Fidel Castre after hia return frea the
Bovict Union. Subjeot olained that ho had spent cight deya with Fidel
during that visit, five ef those abeard ship.

On 2) Ontober 1963 HYSAGR-1 in Ponana City reported that Subjeet had
recoived an operational oesigmment frea Castro (during tho May/June 1963
visit te Habana) on which to travel threugh Cantral and Scuth Ameriea,
liis alcoion was to persuade loftiet parties to imeediately begin acts ef
sabotage and violencs, end to try to maintain thesa in order to take
pressure off Yonozuela. Subject way alen instructed to bring about better
unity azong coupeting leftist factions to ensure greater impact for their
work. Subjsot did, in Pact, eentac’% mamy Ceszzunist Perty and leftist
lesders during his Central and South Aserica travel during the period
October 1963 = Jamary 196). Prea the (fragnentary) reporting an Subject
fron October 1953 through Janudry 1964 4t appeare that he did discuss tho
qnestion of leftiat unity.

In October 196) the Guatemalan authorities captored s mabor of tape
reeordings fres tho guerrillas in operations subsequent to a guorrille
attack en a garrison in Pangos, Alta Verapas. Included in these tapoa ,
was one made by RICO Galan for delivery to the guerrillas. It consists

Veteran and trusted member of the Popular Socialist Party who
has close personal connections with ranking. members of tho .
Party, Io has been ea prolific reporter of rolinble information,
The reported information wos obtained directly from leaders of
both the PPS ond the General Unitun of Workers and Peasants of
Mexico, The substance of these persons' comments are believed
to be accurately reported; their validity however cannot be

assessed,

SOURCE

1. (Summary: Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the
arrest of Yictor Rico Galan and others on charges of conspiring
ageinst the Government remain unsympathetic and the Party
intends to stay outside the entiro matter elthough PPS Sec-
retary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the oppor-
tunity to strike back at some Of his enemies by issuing ae
statement condemning the plans attributed to Rico Galan,
Within the Party there ie considerable akepticiam about the
truth oZ the published charges. While several Party leaders
do not doubt that there is some truth to the charges they aro
quite convinced that there was no danger of imminent reballion
and that Mexican inetitutions atcod in no peril trom Rico
Galan end his friends. Given the enorgy and efficiency with
which the Hexican Government has dealt with ieoss melodramatic
threats in the past, one caznot but suspect that it is merely
a tried and true Government maneuver. Also, it is believed in
the PPS that police accounts of their role in the matter have
been ozaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both
with the President ond with the public. The rumor that the
Guatezalan Governzont may have asked the Mexican Government
to silence Bi¢o Galan because of his violent attacks against
the poy Guatemalan administration ia generally discounted
wince the complaints of Guatemalan officials are certainly

of no concern to Mexico.)

Victor Rico Galan ond bis sssoclates can expect neither sya-
pethy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido
Popular Socialists). Although no official decision haa yet
been made by the Party, PPS iesders who have coamented un-
officially on thé matter have said that for the monont the .
Party will no doubt stay conpletely outside the whole s{fair,
thus proving tts total lnck of interest in this type of revo-
lutionary activity... It 1s of course possible that PPS Secretary
Géneral Vicente Lombardo Toledano will seize the opportunity to
issue a statenont condemning the entire affair as Trotakyist,
criminal, and utopian. Lombardo may decide to use this oppor=
tunity to strike back at tho National Liberation Movement
(MLN - Hovisiento de Liberacion Nacional) and others who havo

attackod hin.

Among leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers
and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM - Union General de Obreros. y.
Campesinos de Mexico), there is a certain skepticiam about the
truth of the matter ss it has been presented in the press, -
It is probably true that ares and materials for manufacturing
explosives vere confiscated. It is probably true that indoc-
trination sesaions' on political and revolutionary matters
probably were. held in ths houses where the arrests were made.
And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action.
But, it is simply not true that there was the slightest danger
of immediate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his:

friends.

This.latter conclusion ie based on the fact that Rico Galan

is no guerrilla leader. He is an aggreasive intellectual, a
radical, but he {s not in jail for what he hoa done but for
his ideas. As for-Raul Hgalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galen
as one of the leaders o @ group, he has the reputation of
being fuzzy-minded, a leftist adventurer and certainly neither
brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Galan igs well aware

of this, popular support is essential to the success of rebellion.
The workers are controlled

Nono exists. Tho peawants are divided.
by the Governnent, and the middle-class ts content with the way

things are. Also, there io the formidable precedont of Govern-
ment action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed,
and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected.
“The Governnent has always moved with energy, speed, and effi-
ciency to combat such threata as, for example, during the
Railway Workers Strike of 1959, Several leaders of that strike
are still in jail and likely to remain thore. Another example

is the September 1965 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Maderg,

Chihuahia,- While the Covernuent did not feel that his incident
posed any real threat to it, it did not want the bad interna-~
tional publicity, so vigilance was increased, activities of
would-be guerrillas were blocked, some were bought off with
money, others with prowises and the asttor was promptly and

efficiently controlled.
There no doubt 18 a degree of truth te police charges, but

_the melodramatic, slaest childish character given to the Rico

Galan movement, the lack of any proven connection betgeon the
Rovenent and leftist/Cosmunist organizations, Rico G.lan's

open and voll-knoun connectiong with Guatemalan guerrilla
leadorea and his public support of the Cuban revolution, aake

it vory hard to discount tho suspicion that this is simply a
Government aanouver. Also, while the police no doubt did
confiscate orega snd other aaterials, the suspicion exists that
the police have inflated thetr role in ordor to wake theaselves
look goud both to the President and to public opinion.

if

There ia even a rumor that because of Rico Galsn'’s hargh attacks
on the new Guatomalan administration, the Guatemalan Government
asked the Mexican Governnent to denl with Rico Galan, This
rumor hovover ia regarded sa rather ridiculous since the

Mexican Government certainly cares nothing for the opinion

of Guatomalan officials.

” CARRY ONLY FIVE PASSENGERS ON ITS MEXICO-TO-HAVANA RUN.) WHEN

ASKED WHY HE DID NOT DO MORE IN CULTURAL PRESS WORK FOR CUBA, LOPEZ G
REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT INPORTANT, BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS

ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEXICO, (SOURCE COMMENT:

LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT

THE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND AP-

PEARED TO FEEL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED WITH THE CASE WHO HAD

NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA,)

1. On 25 April 1966 tho National Liberation Movement (MLN - 7
Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional) held a meeting. in’ ite <
offices at Republica de El Salvador No, 30-301 in observance ..

of the Week of Solidarity with the Dominican Republic. Only
ebout 35 persons attended the sap which was chaired by

“Luis Cordova Ortiz and Gui aicron Ita, in the absence
of leftist Journalist Vics alan who could not attond
because of illness.

: 2. Cordova devoted his speediiate denunciation of the United

Hl States’ "armed invasion" o “the Dominican Republic, calling
it an act which has oroused the indignation of the entire
world. On behalf of the HLN he demanded the withdrawal ‘of
U.S, troops from that country.

3, Guillermo Calderon spoke bricfly about the U.S, presenco in
tho Dominican Republic, but devoted the better part. of his
speech to a criticism of the visit to Mexico of President
Johnson on 14 April 1966. He accused the Mexican aud United
States governments of having kept secret untit the very last
wiinu te the fact of an officinl visit which was falsely described
: as a courtesy visit. The visit was made on the pretext
of unveiling the Lincoln statue, he said, but the fact that
President Johnson brought with hia all the meabers of his
cabinet and his principal advisors, notwithstanding their

preoccupation with problems in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic
and elsewhere, proved that Johnson had come to deal with
matters of great importance to him ond to Mexican President
Gustavo Diaz .Ordaz. Or, he added, was it that Jphnson had
come to glve instructions, or orders, to continue his policy
of oppression of the poople, in this instance Moxico,

Calderon criticized sharply the Mexican Governmgnt for its
methods in organizing the elaborate reception for President
Jobnson. The system of hording together the populace is
accomplished, among othor means, through threatp made by
union leaders. to workors that they will lose a @ay's pay or
suffer other losses if they do not participate in welcoming
coremonies. Calderon denounced officials of the Ministry
of Foreign Relations for having remained silent in the face

“ of a proposal by Secretary of State Dean Rusk fog tho’ creation

of an international police force - "the type of gecurity
forcé that has in‘the past protected countries from North

American aggression".

Again on 28 April the MLN held.a meeting in observanco of
Dominican Week, this one attended by approximately twenty-
five persons, It was announced at the last moment that the
journalist Alberto Domingo, who was to have attended tho
meeting, would not be present because of a more pressing
engagement. In his absence Armando Castillejos Ortiz. . °°

and the poctoss Normn Carrasco improvised a program. Castillejos
expressed regret that the’ MLN does not possess adequate
publishing facilities to keep the Mexican public informed
of the existing situation in the Dominican Republic. He
recommended that those present tke advantage of every oppor=
tunity, in their placos of work and at gatherings elsewhere,
to disseminate by word of mouth the facts of North American
domination over the weaker nations of the world. Ha noted
that ninety percont of the citizens of the United States
are not in accord with U.S, foreign policy.

Norma Carrasco's contribution to the mecting consisted of
the reading of pootry which she had composed depicting the
United States' invasion of the Dominican Republic,

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1, On 13 January 1966 4 Mexico. City newspaper, El Heraldo, publiched an article
which cited a taped speech by Victor Aico Galan to Yon-8oea's guerriliss
as evidence of Rico Calan'’s efforts to undermine the January. 196 visit of
Mexioan. President Diaz Ordaz to Guatemala, A copy of this article is
attached, The taped speech mentioned in the article 138 obvicusly that which
Gueatemalean authorities captured from Yon Soza's guerrillas in October 1964
following a guerrilla attack on o Guatemalan military garrison, This tape
was subsequently made available to-KUBARK and wan passed via the Guatemale
Station to Hoxioco City Station for posaible exploitation in Mexico. The
content of the taped speech was later passed to President Diaz Ordaz by
COS, Mexico City, with a view to stimulating pressure towerd Rico Galen's
expulsion from Moxico as an undesirable alien, How Zl Heraldo ovtained ©
or got word of the taped speech is not know, Since the Fl Heraldo article
was pegged to the current trip to Guatemala of President Diaz trdaz, it is
very probable that the expone was etimilated directly by the Presidensy, in
line with a GOM campaign to neutralize ail existing and gotentiel oppositian

locally to the Preatdentinal trip.

In @ sharp rebuttal in the 26 January 1966 lemue of the prominent Fsxican
~ leftist magazine Siempre, for which he writes regulariy, Yietor Hieo Balan

malcs merxicanos, preparaten una alga:
rada o atentado —esto no se eapecifica:
ba— contra el Presidente Diaz Ordaz, con motivo de su vidje a Guate-
mala. Segin Ja nota “informativa’, que Ilevaba Jas misteriosas siglas
SNG (Servicio de Noticias de Guatemala?), e} principal agente en esa
conjura seria ‘yo, y como pruoba se ofrecia fa supuesia versién taqui-
gréticw de una cinta magnetofénica grabada por mi. Como existié, en
efecto, una cinta que yo grabé, y como en el “pastiche” publicado por
1 Heraldo se utilizam frases que pronuncié realments, creo necesario
explicar Ia historia de todo ello.

Visité por primera vez Guatemala en octubre de1963: En el nimero
de SIEMPRE! dei 30 de ese mes y cho, aparecié publicada una entrevis-
ta mia con el coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, que se iniciaba con esta
descripcién de su persona: “BF coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, “hom-
bre fuarte” de Guatemala, 10 da de ninguna manera la impresién de ser
fuerte. Por el contrario, és oscuro, de hablar premices, con una cons-
tomte actitud timida 7 sin brillantez alguna. No tieno eta tono decidido
de los militares guotomaltecon que. digon cosas inieligentes o tentas, lo
hacen con un éniasis da cuestién sancionada, En loa peoece minutos da
conversacién con 61, mo exchqué muy bien por qué -—pese a mi insis
tencia @n contrario—~ cceptd sélo cant ear mig pre: 8S por escrito.
La tromsoccién final coneizné en que, Unc ‘vez matisle el cucstonario
en esa forma, habloriamos brevemente on au despachn, eokre todo con
el objeto de obtener una fctoqrafia”. .

Esa discrete sugerencia do su tartainudez mental enfurecié al core
nel. Y mas aun, cucnto que en el mismo nimero de SIEMPRE! aparecid
otra entrevista, también mia, con el entonces lider de! movnmiento gue
rrillero quatemalteco. Fi coronel Peralta Azurdia te dijo a un cclega
chileno que to entrevist6 dios despuds que yo, qué 6s vengoria do mi
donde quiera que me encontrass. 1Y me i:nagino, 19 sia humer, el co
raje que debe haber hecho cuando el colega chilens prublicd su propia
reportoje,.. y coincidid conmigo en lo de la tartasucdez rental del se
for coronel! :

Lo cierto es que el hombre intenté en reiteradas ocasiones cumplir
su promesa. Con mative de su informe de gobierno, vonsmiido por ras
dio y televisién a toda Guatemala, me acusé de haber ido a ese pais a
organizar “grupos de choque”, y la AP y Ia UPi se encargaron de difun-
dir la noticia, que la patriota, nacionclista y sohdcria prensa mexicana
gublicé profusamente. El coronel “so vengaba", y yo owlé por no dar
importancia a la irtitacién de un perscnaje tan menor, ieritacién que.
por otra parte, me explicaba perlectamente.

Regresé a Guctemala un afo después, precisamenié en octubre
de 1964. Y. olectivemerte, grabé un mensaje en cinta megnetofénica,
destinadoa a varios guerilieros a fos que no pude ver Neda tenia de
misteriosa ese mensaje. Centenia un saludo, alguncs apreciacicnes so
bre el movimiento guerriilero hechas sobre al terreno por el cbservador,
por el periodista, y noticias pora los que tenian familares en México Ne
una rola palabra que fuera necesario ocultar, ni unc scic idea que no

daridad abierta y pibhea con quienes luchan por la bberted de su pu.
tra? Muche mancs que misterio a3 delito, y yo ma encrjullezco de 65a

Lo certo es, ain embargo, que o37 cinta no leg} a sus destinata-
rios, porque fie axpturada por el aerate guatemeliece ¥ 1 osronel

v chintayes canta muchos personos, odas que se acusaba de ser men
cianedas en la cinta y de coluborar conmigo en mun tenebrosas conan
tacicnes En mayo de 1965, el dictrio guatemaliers Promoa Libre -- el de
mayer arculaciin en Bu pals-- hizo publica urs de esas “vermenes””
«De dénde ia habla obten:de? De un boletin env »to por lo obcine de
prensa del coronel Peralta Azurdia Y esa‘ verucn’ tenia por chete
justheer la exrulsén -- entofces recente — del duttinguido intelectual
y jalitico guctemalteco Frencisco Villagrén Kramer, nenaonade en ba
cinta, lo cual era “prueba” de que conspiraber coniniyo .
éY¥ por que téio Prensa Libre paiblicé la version? Pues por la razon -
ample de que seovenia de un boletin oheal, 4 Jos otros periods de
Guatemcla re negaren a acupterlo si no se les sermilia or la tomosa
cinta. Y claro que no se les pertnitié Bojo una dictorfura militar, los r
riddices quatemaltecos tuviercn més ética profesional que El Heraide
en un régimen de hbertad de prensa. Pero ast son las cosas. Y algo que
es también importante hacer notar: Prensa Libro, tan oficialista que aco
-gié la guna columnia, es el periddico que ha hecho Is campana ma
gresera y negctiva contra fa visita del Presidento Diaz Ordaz a Guate-
mala. .

La “versién” de El Heraldo tiene por objeto acusarme, a mi y a
otras personas, de ccnspirar para echar a perder kc visita del Presidente
Uaz Ordaz a Guatemala Yo fui a ese pais por dllima vez —repito—
en octubre de 1964, cuando el licenciado Dioz Ordaz era Presidente
Electo eCémo iba a saber.que se proponia visitor Guatemala? eCémo
iba a hablar de Jos asaltantes del cuarte! de Ciudcd Madera, en Chihuo-
hua, si eso sucedié a fines de 1965, y en octubre de 1964 nada sucedia
en Chihuahua? Eso, para mencionar sélo des de las més abultadas fal-
sedades de la “versién” Se utilizan unas cuantas frases auténticas, yse
edcba una supuesta grabacién para cada caso.. Sencillo y sin problemas.

Pero, ademas, el coronel Peralta Azurdia se propone otra cosa cen
la “versi6n” do El Heraldo. Se propene justficer las extremadas pre-
ccuciones pelicicoas qua tomé para preservar aw vida ~-no la del Pre
sidente Diaz Ordaz—~ y Ia mala impresién que «zo, y la fulta de asistem
cic popular a ja recepcién, tuvo que cesar al huésped 7 a su conutya
Pose a qua la tartamudes mentel del coronel Perclts Azurdia y ta de
eclaboradores meacenes on 4} sugio adebs da k S perm
stquiera sélacionar Seta con el vieja preacdenael, vz neticia terraine dis
clendo: “Por toda veto (epor qué?) el yoblame de Guatemala creyé per
iguron ka ve

tinente tomar tericds Joa medidas necesarins que gare
rided cle} raandatario mexicana y da tos tr: tron de su cominva,
rante su visit ¢ muentra nacién”.

Pero la verdad «3 que tales precauciones 54 tomaron poru ganmti-
zar la sequridad del coronel Peralta Azurdia —esa si muy amenazada-—,
y no la do! Preaidante Dfuz Ordaz, contra el cual ne tenia nada e! pueblo
de Guatemala, ¥ ct que sélo los periédicos recccienaries —en parhcular
Prensa Libre— ctccaron Tan ex asl, que si bien en la copatal el Presi.

—~pora no aplaudy a Peralta Azurdia—, en La Antigua, a donde el icen-
ciedo Diaz Ordez tue solo, si hubo recepcién popular entusiasta y se-
braron las precesuciones polictacas. Claro, no estaba Peralta Azunca!

Y, én‘relavién con esto, hay algo que ef pebhoo mexico depa
saber. La Universidad de Son Carlos de Guatemata ta considero seria
mente la idea de otergarle al Presidente Diaz Crdez ef grado de dator
honoris causa, El cisunto se debatié extrcoficiaimente en ef Consero Uni-

Notes for
, 4 . A Portrait of a Castro-Commualet | aug y 1 1909
Agent .

r .
Victor Rico Galan waa born 6 Fobruary 1928 in El Ferrol, Spain, He is

Spanish by birth, bocamo a Mexican citizen by naturalization in March 1949,

He ia married to Ingeborg Dienar da Rico Galan, born 1) May 1929 in Medco

City,. He residos at Ernestina Larraingar 19-5, Col, dol Valle in Mexico City.

He ‘writes for both Slomprg, Mexico City leftist newe-waekly, and Politica,

pro-~Commualst bi-weekly newemagazine,

VRG coportedly talked to Fidel Castro ard Che Guevara in 1961 regarding
thy formation of the Movimiento de Libexacion Nacional (MLN) in Mexico,
With tholr approval ha boaimo one of the founding members of the MLN and
loter headed tha MLN Press and Propaganda Committas. Ina speech to the
MLN in April 1962 he stated, "The governmeat must be mads to understand that
only the people have the right ty violence." (Thie was in reference to the
Mexican govermmont repression of the Communist Party and ite arrest of

David Alvaro Siquiares,)

In an article in Slampre in Mavch 1963 VRG advocated the formation of a
new politiesl party reflecting thy ideology of General Lazaro Cardenas, former
Prealdont of Mexico. VRG sald this ney political party wae necced to traly
reprasent the radical tendencies of tha 1910 revalution. VAC conceived this new
party ae the political arm of the revently-furmed MLN, which could thus develop
into a bread national pro-Communist movement liko the FRAP in Chile.

VRG has always been very cloas ond syroprithotic to the Castre-Cuhan
revolution, In 1961 he was a member of the Perjodipjas Mexicanos Amigos dy
Guha, Also in 1961 he was veportad to be a member of the Cormmitiss for

- Solidarity with the Cuban Ravolution, Ia March 1942 ha waa reportedly a
member of i- group of four pro-Castroites whe made an abortive physical attack
on EmiQio Uranga, writer for Slarmprg- who has written aiti-Caatre fiems, Ae
the group converged on Uranga other membera of the Slompra stali istervened
and the matter waa settlad without violence.

"From October to Dscembar 1942 VRG waz in Cuba, as a correspondent
for Slompra and alaa reportedly to gathor materia! for a soliticel biography

of Fidel Castro. In an articlo written for Siempre while he waa in Cuba
(Sigmpre 31 Oct 62) ho oxtols the grost Cuban revolution and the advantages
Castroism hae brought to the lower clacses. Ina later article (Siempre

14 Nov 62) he attacke the Soviet Union and Khrushchev for their weakness during
the Cuban missile crisis, Ho refers to Fidel Castro ae being the vanguard of

the revolution against Colonialiem.

3
From late.May to mid June 1968 VRG was again in Cuba, thie time to

intervisw Fidel Castro following tho latter's return from the Seviet Union,
VRG roportedly spent § days with Fidel Castro, five of them aboard the Cuban
leades's yacht, and also interviewed other Cuban leaders, including Blas Roca,
Secrotary~Genoral of the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP + Cuban Communist
Party); Ernesto "Cha" Guevara Serna, Minister of Incuatries; Oswaldo
Dorticos Torrado, Cuban President; and Raul Roa Garcia, Miniater of Foreign

Relations,

It was during this May-June 1963 contact with Fidel Castro and other Cuban
leadars that VRG recaived a major operational assignment. He was given the
muosion of traveling through Central and South America to contact local
Communist and guerrilla leaders. His job was to persuade these groups to begin
campalgno of violoncs and terror immediately in order to take the prossure aff.
the FALN in Venesuela, whose program of terror, heavily subsidized by Castro,
waa beginning to run inte increased sesiatance from the Venesuslan government
forces, On this trip VAG also had the minsion of bringing about greater unity
amoung the varicus Cammunist and terroristic sroupa,

In late 1963 VRG undertook his assigned missien, He traveled to Panama,
Gustemelia, Costa Rica, Vanezuela, Nicavagua and Brasil and contacted kay
Commeuntets in each of theea countrias,

Among the Communist leaders which VRG contacted an this trip were

Ramirez waa given considerable radio and press publicity in Nicaragua. The
proce referred to "secret moetings" in VRG's hotel room betwem Ramires
and VRG. Ramirez answered by writing letters to the newspapers, saying he
met VRG quite openly in his office and that VRG had called on hirn because ho
(VRG) wao a legitimate journalist who wae secking interviews with various
political figures, On 24 October Ramirez wag interviewod on radto and
finally reluctantly admitted that he had gone to VRG's hotel room. He said
hia purpose in going there was to take VRG to his (Ramirez's) office. :

nm Panama VRG stayed at the Hotel International. While in Panama he ;
visited US installations and was seen taking many picturas. Hie talks with :
Hugo Victor and David Turner wore aimed at getting the VAN and the PDF te
resolve their differences and to unite. Turner briefed VRG on VAN's preparations
to establish an armed movement in Panama, Victor, on the other hand,

spurned VRG's to unify the two groups.

Following this trip in late 1963, VRG returned to Cuba (in January 1964)
and visited Fidel Castro apain and to report on the results of his contacts with
Central and Latin American Communist leaders.

In late March 1965 VRG (with hia wife) again travelad to Cnba to roport
to Cuban leaders. ile raturned to Mexico in oarly April 1965,

In May 1964 VRG was invited to visit Red China, ostensibly as a gueet of
the All-China Journalists Association, which indicated it would be willing to ~
pay ail costu, including transportation, Becausa of other pressing work In
comaction with hig assignments on behalf of Castro, VRG did not accapt this

brvitation.

Over tho years 1961 to 1965 VRG‘s contacts with the Cuban Embaasy in
Mexico City hava inersased steadily. He meets frequantly and regularly with
various officials of the Cuban Embasay, asually at his hocne, at the Siempre
offices or at ths homes of the Cuban clficials in Maxico City.

Hie moot frequont contact in with Aianuel Eugenio Voga Peres, Third
Sacretary of the Cuban Embaesy and chiof reorersntativa af the Dirrecion Ganeral
Obese and outwardly
jolly, Yoga Peres waa the driver of a beer truck in Havana prior to the Cubaa
Reolution which launched him on bis intelligence carger. :

Another VRG Cuban intelligence contact is Ramon Sinobas Casado, Counselor
of the Cuban Embassy. Sinobas is Voga's assistant in'handling" VRG. It is
apparent that these contacts are primarily for the purpose of channeling VRG's
reports and instructions to and from Cuba. In the course of his work as an
agent for Castro and the DGI, VRG is known to have acted as a courier, carrying
material and large suma of money to pro-Cuban groups in Central and Latin
American countries,

In October 1964 VRG received another important assignment fram his
Cuban masters. VRG was requestod to travel to Guatemala to make a personal
survey of the strength and weaknesses of Marco Antonio Yon Sova's guerrilla
forces and to lay the basis for a mora energetic implemontation in Guatemala
of the tactical principles for guerrilla warfare laid down by ''Che" Guevara,

“This was, in effact, 2 follow-up to his varlier vicit to Yon Sosa during his

swing through Contral American countriea in late 1963, At that time, VRG
attersptod to persuade Yon Sova to align himself more closely with Castro's
objectives in Latin America, The roaults of this visit to Guatemala were
written ap by VRG ina special report to Castro, YRG's conclusions at that
tirne were not completely favorable to Castro,

Yon Sosa is known to be a forceful and tndopendsnt puerrilia leader who
prides himself on his ability to maintain aiimseli and his followera indepandantly
of ideclogical padance from either Havana, Psking or Moacow, although he is
quita willing to accept arms and financial support from any of theaee Camraunist
capitals. Ia tha past Castro's efforts to bring Yon Sosa te heel have bean
thwarted mainly by the iniluence the Chinoae Communists have dean able to
exert over the Guatenialan guerrilia leader, In addition te the direct ald
provided by Peking to Yon Soaa and hia guerrillas in Northeastern Guatemala,
thare 1a the fact of Yon Soga's Chinesa background (Yon Sosa's father was
Chinese) which has served to He him omatlonally to the Red Chinese.

It wae the continuing recalcitrant attituda of Yon Sova which apparently
prompted VRG'a second miseion ta Guatemala in October of 1964, YRG was
instructed not only to talk to Yon Sasa but also to try to influence Yon Sosa'e
guerrtlia forces directly In line with Castro's objectives. In addition to prapared
matarial which VRG uaed for lecturing the guerrillas he Lrought eith him special
propaganda Hlma for indoctrination purposes,

In late October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape
recordings from Yon Sosa's guerrillas following a guerrilla attack on a goverument



--- Page 127 ---
<5e

garrison, Included in these tapes was one made by YRG for delivery to the ©
guerrillas during his carly October visit with them. A copy of this tapo is
attached. Tho tape consists mainly of an oxhortation by VRG for unity (between
tho Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT) and the 13 Novomber Group}

and 4 ploa not to permit ideological argumonts to replace action. In this speech
VRG reveals himsclf to be a hard-headed revolutionary activist, not merely an
intellectual loftiot, His approach to revolution is completely practical, not the -

oretical,

“Po cover hic miesion as a Castro political action agent to Yon Sosa, VRG
later publiohed an "interview" with tha latter (in Slampro No. 593, 4 Novamber

1964).

VRG!'a involvement in the recent Dominican crisis lo the lateat example of
hie work op behalf of Cantro, In early January 1944 VRG travelled to Santo
Domingo, returning a weak later to Mexico. Ostensibly this trip was to report
on Dominican Kepublic affairs for Slamprg, Actually this waa morely 4 cover
for a Communist propaganda aasignmont. Shortly after VRC left Santa Domingo,
thousands of copics cf a pro-Cuatro brochure, entitled "Glgnapre visita la
Dominicana’ and signed VRG, wore distribnivd among Cornrunistes and
Communist sympathizers in the Dominican Repablic, A copy of this brochure

fig attached,.

During his January 1964 trip VAG contacted both tha Mavimianto Popular
PDeminicung (MPD), a terroristic revolutionary Marxiet~Leniutst and strong

Gatores do Junio (APCJ), a militant, revolutionary pro-Gastro group. His
contact with the MPD resuited in hia furnishing material to the subversive

MPD publication, Libertad, But his principal contact, ong that developed
sapidly inte a very activa relationship in the pagied preceding the Dominican
erlota, wae with Juan B, Majla, leader/of the APCJ, Thase two have maintained
gloss and fruquent contact over the past yaar, During tha Dominican crisis VRG
sarved ao 4 relay point for material and inetructiona from Cuba to the APCI

and also acted aa a reporting channel from Mejia te the DGl and tha APCJ's

Castro-Cuban leadership in Cuba,

As ta previous operations of this klad, VRG clonked his relationship
with Mojia under a journsiiotic cover, An “intarview' he conductad with Mejia
appeared in the 2 May 1965 laeue of the Cuban aewopaper Hoy, A copy of
tho text of that article io attached,



--- Page 128 ---
14-0000

- thay apparently touched off a bitter dispute between YRG and Jose Pagas Llargo,

‘known in journalistic circles in Maxico and the Suares-Moya Incident appaara

In mid-May 1965 a gaffe by Mojia's and VRG's Cuban superiors oxposed the
Mejia-VRG=*Cuba channel publicly. Inan article carried by Porto Alegre
(Brasil) newspaper Gorreio do Povo on 20 May, datalined New York 19 May .
by Louls Wisniser, a Radio Havana broadcast of 18 May was reported to have
mentioned a declaration by Juan Mojia sent from Santo Domingo to VRG in Moxico,
who then sent the declaration to Radio Havana, After citing this channel by
which it received the Mejia statement, Radio Havana proceeded to broadcast
the following excerpts from the declaration: "Numerous leaders of the 14 June
Party have disappeared but I (Mejis) know that they are now in the mountains :

~e

‘leading guerrillas, The 14 Juno Party haa control of the situation in Santo

Domingo." The Corergig do Povg noted editorislly that the Radio Havana broadcast
seeme to negate the Castro effort to deny that the 4th June Mavoment in the
Dominican Republic is tied tohim., The article concludes by noting that Mejia

was one of the 538 Coramunists Meted by the Americana, and that this confession

by Havana puts new Nght on the quastion of American intervention in the
Dominican Republic, Not noted in the article ie the fact that VRG's role as t
an intermediary between Mojla and Castre is claarly exposed by the Radio :

When the Dominican rebellion erupted VRG began te agitate with the Siqmpre
staff for outright and total suppurt to the pro-Castyo forces in the rabel camp,
Those offorts bogan to bear fruit whan VRG was allowed to personally brief and
dispatch a Siempre cerreepumlont~ photographer taam to the Dominican Republic
in early May 1955 to vepors on the crisis, The correspondent waa Luis Suares ,
Lopes; the photographer was Laiy Rodrigo Moya Morano, ‘Cha resulting articles
in Siempro prodacad by this ¥VRG-Suaras-Moya team ware violently anti-US and
pro-Castro Communiat in thaly intaypretation of the erioia =~ 80 much 69 that

Siomorg director, who prefsra to stich to the traditional Slampre role of a
pacudo-indopendant outlet for a variety of leftist causes, VRG's afforta to
reorient Siempre along mora militant pro~Gommuniat lines has long been

to have precipitsted an open fight between tha two, VAC ia apparently aiming

for a showdown with Pages Liergo over this tysue, since several Siampre
writers are known to la va daen individually approached by VRG over the paat
weeks to enlist thelr support against the progent Signipza editorial policy,

which VRG regards aa too ‘opportunistic.’

CONTACT REVORT ; _
SUBIECT: Keoting with WUINDIOO, 1 Nay 1965

: J. RUTHERFORD net W/1 at the latter's apartaant on 18 Hay 1965:

2. The following information was obtained:

a. Rominiean Republic. During the briefing by the Fi representative
on 14 May, it wae agroed that 1/1 vould attenpt to have the Havana broadcast
of 2 May replayed through his friend. Mauro LUGENTINI of ANSA, New York. It ~
waa felt that thie approach would bo more desirable than using k/l directly,
in view of his offorta to appear as a liberal journalist. During the
meeting ¥/1 attempted to contact Lucentini, but’ ascertained that he had gono
eff on a holiday for the weekend. Upon learning that Lueentint vould retura
to New York City during the evening of 16 May, it was agreed that ¥/) would
eontast him at that time in an effort to have tho story tramuatted on 17
May.’ In addition to thé major capitals in Latin America, t/l.also thought
that the story would be sent to Rone.

bo. Fellewing a ‘phone call from tho kH Desk, RUTEERYOKD subsequently
bricfei #/1 on the fact that the sane story hed heen sarricd in the 2 ay
edition of Hoy in Havana, (OOMGENT: RUTINRFOR) pointed out to the Head~
Quartus rep thot, in his opinion, it might sot ba advisable to inform
Lacentind of the Hoy article ds it might rales an ebjectian in his sind con-
ceming the currant valus of the new.)

6, Sriefed on both tho radio broadeact and the fioy article, b/1
was disinclined to mention the Hoy article to Lacentint for the sane
objection noted above, fia waa inglructed to uss iis om diservtion.

Y

ad, tm the avening of 16 day ¥/1 contacted Lucentdal am outlined hig
request, He explained to Lucentini that thio was a good opportunity Ser
a sadop on a het ites, 8/1, in order to ofrset any objections on the part
of imountini, told him that the railo breedcast. had occurred on 13 Hay.
He did net mention the Hoy artisle, Accomiug vo bl, Lussntini was lesa
than enthustastde about trancaltting the atory throuch hia Sacilities,
pointing out that it was co Jongar news. After some persuasion, accorting
to t/1, laecentind finally awreni to cond the folloving abureviated story
to Duanos Ablres either the evening of 16 Nay or early 17 May:

"Qn Friday, Hay 13, nadie-Havana cited Juan 2, Hajia leader of
ioainican '14 of Juno’ party who hod given an interview te Mactean
journalist Victor Lico Galan in uhich he declared over the telephone that
imany leaders of the June 1, rovezent have diserpeared, but at the sane
tine nunarouw contingents af insurgents are reporter in the mountains of
tee meen and thet 'the 14 af June movensnt has mich control of the
aituation.'-

6. In order to supplement tho Lucentini effort, ¥/2 prepared a
more detailed version of the radio broadcast and cabled it to Corraig
EER in Porto Alegre, Brasil. He paid for the cable in New York

»70) and signed it with his first and last initials ant “our NY
correspomient.” tho cabled article in Spanish io forvarted heredith
as attachnent #2,

f. O) Ketinicin. Qn 17 May 3/1] was invited to a cocktail party at
the home of Lucentini, 305 Fast 56th Street, NYC. The reception was on
the occasion of the departure of Ricardo Berla, Vico Presidant of Olivetti
Underwood in Hew York. /l was surprised to find that KaLinkin, the
Bovict euployéd in the UN Secretariat, was present. It will be recalled
that W/1 originally met Kalinkin at the hone of Faubion bowers in Manhattan
in June 1964, Lucentini wae also present on-that occasioii. /l could.
not comment on whether Lucentind met Kalinkin for the first tine at the
Bowers affair, /1 is not aware of any close relationship between Kalinkin

and Lucentini.

3. Finances:

2.0 Out te 09. Victor Kico Galan (VxG) with long distence operator,
VuaG hag been ceporting in from the phone of a friend's house, but he is

now at home. As soon ag they have communication to Cuba, call hia here.
With Se. Orilaado Fundora of with Sc. ViNtjas, kadio Habana. :

in Cuba? With Pundoca or Vifias? Yea. VAG takes the phone. Says.
thece ia no one by the name of Pundosa of Yifies inkadio Habana, Of
course, they are the Director aad Sub-Director of kadio Habana.

Finally geta through to Fundora. VxG seys that they talked to
Bosch lost night - at 2330. VkG couldn't call him because line was out
to Cuba. Bosch made sensational declarations. MO will record it,

They change phones. -They asked Bosch what his opinion wes of -
the 0.8.A. Comaigaion. VkG did not talk, but a Dominican friend talked
to Bosch. However, theysécorded the conversation, Bosch said some
deportant things. This friend ssked Bosch what he thought of OFA Cos-
miaion, Bosch said that 0.8.A. and nothém are tho sane thing. who
talked to Bosch, marcio Aejia Kicart. They then asked Soach if thay
gf the U.S. naxines had occupied the city. He said they hed and they
bad gotten as far ag Avenida Melia, near downtown area, but thet the
asmed civilions forced thea back until Avenida Maxino Gomez, about
3-1/2 kilonetera back, Ave. Maxiso Gomez is what one might call
theic combat line since it ia tha zone where the U.S. Eabasay ia.

So, they asda them ceturn to thelr oxiginal pat peaitions. This took
place yesterday afternoon. But the most important thing - they asked
Bogch what political solution Bosch saw. Ie anawered "textually -

'N¢ appears that in Washington-they dre thinking of converting Santo
Domingo ina Pideicomiso.’ Thea he commented fronically, 30 "we get

out of colonialism into independence.” VG asys, that this is of course
very grave. Aa FP. knows there are 2 of 3 left in the world - of
Pideicoaigog - in Southern Afsica. This would ba unprecedented case -
that they convert an independent country into a country under Fidei-
comizo (Protectorates). When Mejia aicact asked if they (U.S.) want

to convert "ug into a colony.” Bogch replied. that - Yeo, into a colony
but with 25,000 armed gen, Civilians, of course, Beach furthers aaid
that “what. the people had done was something extsacddinary and tat he
hed complete falther in the people," i. did not want to say anything
to provoke the uprising of the people because he (Sosch) ia out of the
country “and from outside, this la a comfortable role, If ¥ were inside
I would tske up the cesponsibitites.“

VxG had to pay the catl since Fundorea Gid act call him. VG
will be cuined. this, so Pundora should have e call alwaya in for VG.

VxG edil tet hin knew when he has anything new.

F. aska what the aituation 4a ingide Voniaican cepubiie. There
ie nothing aww, They are expecting a call from Dominican nepublic to-
day. VaG asy have semething in 2 hours. In thia case, VaG will call.
F. will then call VxG back at 2300, Habana tina, or 2200, Nexico tine.

The foolish thing waa what VuG did ~ gave thea the names, He gave. theese

1. The Mexico City Station has been requested by the
Press Office of the Embassy to assist in briefing Mr. Robert
Struthers, a roving reporter of the Reader's Digest, who is
preparing an article on Cuban/Communist subversion in Latin
Agerica and who has expressed displeasure that’ the Embassy
has been undble to provide any briefing on Communist activi-
ties in Mexico and Central America.

2. Mexico City Station and Wi! Division feel that par-
ticularly since the Spanish cdition of the Reader's Digest
has a circulation of over two and one-half million copies,
this is an excellent avenue for the otherwise planned sur-
facing of abundant information (including the existence of
a tape recorded speech to Guatemalan guerrillas, recently
captured) on Victor RICO Galan, an active Cuban agent and
a regular contributor of the weekly leftist magazine,
SIEMPRE.

3. A briefiag oa the activities of Victor RICO Galan
and a replay of the taupe has already been given officially
in Guatemala during the January meeting ef the Security
Ministers of Central America. No press play inas yet been
made.

ot CA/Propaganda defers to you for a policy decision.
There are no RY traces on Mr. Kobert Struthers. Struthers is
favorably known to Mr. Paul Chretien's office which has per-
sonality and professional data on hin. .

5. NH Division recommends that you release the attached
cable.
