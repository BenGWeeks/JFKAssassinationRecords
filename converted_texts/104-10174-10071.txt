as the spark plug and leading light. -fkis unsatisfactory position

cactioned against ezphasia on Lasxy's participation. (Attachment A).

3. Fron the beginning, the hore office was cognizant of the danger of
a. spotlight being tErown on any evert-U. 8. ezployee, and, in addition to
previous warnitgs, on 7 April cabled apecifie inetractions for the retire—
Bert of Lasky.t¢o the teckground. bis and other adasnitions, from the home

atance, where. tiie. Congreas received ite greatest “publicity output, “out of
180 newspaper clippings which are availatle, approxiiately 15 specifically . .
featured Lasky, some of them photographically. Of the U. S. and British’. | -
press clippings which were available, several featured Lasky prominently. ,

however, was ‘laudatery and polluted up the eiecerity and usefulness of the
gatcering. The holdirg of the Congreas in Zerlin vas descrited as ‘a
gesture of defiacce"; tha reeting waa called aa event of "coneicerable sig-
nificance® (atrong words fer the Lozdon Eezr st) and it was referred to
point of the western counter-
Attack in the cold war.! "Corea," said the caoczis!, "sade the fortune

of the Congress and crystaliized the real issze before tke delegates.®
Trevor-Ecper, in a letter te the Econozist, commenting on its article, waa” *
kuch more temperate than in his article in tre Guardian. For example,

in the Zcchozist he declared, “We were alxost all united against Comunisn -
from the start.™ * :

5. At this point, At ‘should de specified that fron the time the Con-
eress was first discussed; it: was Tecognizeé that the Conminist press:
would indict it asa faaciet, war mongering, ‘propaganda group operating ander

“the intelligence auspices of the .'S. and that this aecisation would be.

broadcast by

é Conmurist machine (ast vés) whether or-not, in fact the
Congress én tt t

under any external controls. It was aléo recognised that
{ secretary of the Congress: would inevitably receive a certain
amount of attenticn from the press. It seers to be clear, however, that this
amount of attertion was unnecessarily large.

6. Notwithstanding the undue persoral publicity achieved by Mr. Lasky,

“4h. is eignificart that:

a. He played a most ircortant role im tha conception, develop-
Rent, organization and control of the Congress. Without his active
interest and support the launching of the Congres would have been
“most aifficult. . co coe ne o toe

be The Congress was.a highly successful operation. In its stand
against intellectual neutrality in the atrazgle against Commisn,
ite Getter to the East,” its final "Manifesto," and its déliderations
and intellectual discussione, the Congress has. proven its propaganda
value waich will te extended and expaniec to a greater degree in the

that Mr. Lasky ia needed as one of the principa] organizers and opera-

What happened to the berlin news overage by. US correspondents?

which cost the US ‘about two thousand piecos of Bituce 7 (It seems

‘okear that their attendanc was absolutely worthless othern250.)

’ What happoned to their efforts to obtain delegates fron
‘the Middle East? :

* Why did Lasky proceed with a dozen last mime. Invitations

realisation that 4f the Congress wes a success, it was only a.
_ guocess as far as it wont, and it has a long way to 50 to completely
---- guatify itself < the next a ore NOT being spending a lot’ of dough for

SUBJECT + 4 Confidential Sepert Received By Schiller on
\ * Berlin Congrose for Culitaral Froodop ,

J. Yhon Mr. Stribling’s chop requested mo, at the pdehost of
a cabdle requost of Hr. Hambley, to attezpt to appeasa Schiller in
connection. with his indignstion fer the sanner in which kax Tergin,
/$ho Arorican Negro, had-doen handled in Berlin, Schiller eacted in
the manaor described in uy earlier neaorandun on this subject, which
‘waa ‘on the whole satiefactory. he dad since received a complete re-
port, frea s reliable and conpetent observer at the Serlin Congress”
which f as. quoting below: Sok .

"on the wholé, the Congress has achieved somo useful results. .
In ay opinion, the test thing about the Congress was that it vao
held in Berlin. A Congress in faric, ia Switzerland or tn any
otner place would have had neither the enng political oigsificance
ner yould it hava roceived the sane cudlicity. For the Berlinors,
the fact that Berlin waco chosen as the meeting place was reneved
proof of Yeotern ‘solidarity vith thoir reeistance ngainet the
Rusojans. They nosd- such procf agaln and agdin, especially ia
view of the fact that they have a definite and justified impression
that the Bonn Government te not inclined to manifest any particular
_ fervor as far as help for the 3erlin pepulation 19 concerned.

.., She Congress, moreover, ‘Nas bean j“awcegeo Inagmuch”as it
chowed the determination of an isportant group of intellectua:s,
scholars, and artioteto leave no longer unchallenged Coscuniet
attesote to dominate the sceno through their various ‘cultural?
front organisations. The pereaneat machinery established by the
Congress for the murpose of continuing its work may ve of great
‘{eportanée provided that certain conditions aro observed in it?
-activitios, Lo. :

eritical resarke. regarding certain phases and
fof the Corgress. should not be construed as on

fact that tho Congress has achieved a usafal - ---
purpose. Sor fo this eriticica mado from a perfectionist point of. -
view. Sovever, waile it je sdnitted that In a gathering cf artiets,
“geholara, and writers, sany of whos tend to display prima-donna -
attitudes ant a spirit of coterie, a certain azount of friction
fe inevitable, 1¢ cannot be said that everything was done to reduce
such frictions to a @inisun, As.a result, many delogates when I
had an opportunity to.aex for their impresaiona of tho Congresa,
‘oft. Berlin with sixed feelings, soxe of them not without as certain
amount of disappointaent. ~ - ae : i

1) that | about 70% of tho delegates wero poople who professed

and 3) that tha chairsan of the Congrens sas “ret Reuter, head of
the social] democratic city government of derlin -- Koestlor's attack
was absolutely out of place and sho:Jd not have been made regardless
of. whether he waa right or not. Aga matter of fact, the paper in
question pr ved that KXoestlor is mistaken th (assuming that a brilliant
journalist and a saccesoful rovelist 18 a9 ipeg qualified to play the
role of a philosopter, bfstorian and sociologist. In addition,
nigtaken statements by British Labor regarding the proble of

a Yuropean unity donot jrotify in my opinion the kind of vitriolic
all-out attack. against the 3ritish Labor Government which was msde
by Koeetler who. seena to have forgotten, that, regardless, what one

~ooyo may think of sone ‘of its policies, British Labor is today one of the =~

principal pillars of*the world democtati¢ front.

: ‘Evidently Keestlar's attack crovoked tmcediate reaction on the
part! of the Socialist Congress delegstaa, beginning with Reuter who |
was fn the chair, ‘In my opinion, this entire discussion was complately
unnecessary. The British conservative N. P., Arery, showed mach
better judgment than Koestler by stadfadly avoiding in ile pronounce-
ments, any criticisa of the Labor Government. If an attitude sintlar
to that of Xoestler would have been adopted in the trade union field,
the I.C.F.7.U. could not have been created. As in the labor movenent,

_ the organitation of intellectuals for the defense of democracy cannot
be auecessfel unlese it to understood that decocratic socialiem ia a
rover ful tnfiuenca asong the. best intellectuals of Europe and Asia

- and that, therefore, everything should be done. to secure cooperation |
of all democratic forces in erite of all ideological differences. I
was rather astonished. to find thit Irving scomed to. like Koostler's
discouree on aoclaliaz. ‘I spoke “with: quite a nuzber of dologates and

fouhd that they dida't Like ‘At at all.

You will notice that the sanifesto treats tho question of cultural
freedom principally from tho point of view of the Journalist and less
from that of the scholar and the artiota. At leaat thie ie my. opinion,

Sunday morning plane. Due.to sae mechanical difficulty, that olane did :

‘planes were chartered for the stranded students, I even spoke to Er,
.  Buttles-2bout getting ir. Mehring on one of the chartered planes if

not turn up our counter-Gresz campaign would have looked bad, I therefore —

\__ The underaigned callod upon Professor Hook at his hows, 696-A Third

| , Sereet, Brooklyn 15, H. ¥., at 3:00 ofclock on April 22,1950 to discuss

_ | ‘domestic arrsayenonts:in support of the Congress, for which Frofesoor Hock

-._, Professor Houk opened the conmveraation ty exphasiaing the nead to
ainicdso the Governsnt's interest in the Congress. He folt that it vas -
essential to retain tho ap;carance. of a completely private venture, I

 essured hig this wae elso the Department's viéw. Referring to tho etatua |

of Walvin J. Lasky, secretary of tha Congress in Berlin, aa an exployee. :

of HICOG, Profozsor Hook then eaid he thought tr. Lasky showld bs given: |

a lsavé of absonco in order to carry through. tha project ina private. |
capacity. I promised to look into thia problos, and coumented that it.
eould not be done readily without Mtr, Lasky's cooperation, i also :

_ Suggested that ainco Er. Lasky to oy knowledge wee spending como of his .

' persensl funds on prepuratione for. the Congress, it would only ba fair -

Gm contiming the discussion, it waa elear that in working elone
Professor Hook had as yet beer smile to neke eny censiderahle progress
on behel? cf the Congres, and tiat there tas urgent seed for (a) a
Binium staff to bindle the pregres in thig country and (b) — exall

“-aliceetion cf funds to per for talgphone, stationery, publicity, ete,

and apparertly bas hed to be extrenely careful

___In-roply ‘to’ wy"quary ac to etat sort of tdget votld be nscetsary,

Professor Hook sugzsted that 32 eoclé needa secretary-typiat for tuo . oe

months and a public relations ‘gaa ‘oa a pert-tite basis for the azo periods .

-- Be. thonght the secretary could te ob-eined for $250 a month and the pub--

“Uelty min’ for less than $500, In eésition, $500 vould be sufficient for -
such itess as rertal of typewriters, stationery, telephone calla; postage,
ete. This would Inke a total baiget of £2,000, The rental expense could ~
be reducet, he thought, ty using the offices of The Ney Leader, a Socialist
publiecation-of which ha is.one ef the editors. fle did not think it adviae~
able to havea pretentious office, since obvious affluence would incite |
suspiecien, The setivity could be organised-by snericana for Intellectual
Freedom, of which he ia the founter. This group staged the.anti-Comnmist

* program in How York in March: 1%¢ fer.lsss than 225,00,

: .Proféssor. Fook hoped that it ‘wociz rot be necessary to use military trans-
. portation, sinés that vould create the ispression of Govornment sponsor- -

ship. He tho:ght comercial trazspertetion would definitely be preferable, :
and added that he would like to te ina position to give cash grarts to

tue delegates cf about $706, that is, the romd-trip ‘fare plus a few. dollars
over for incidentals, He felt it: would bo undssirable for too large an 2

American representaticn to be aszt. Frotably .2ix or seven people veuld: ne Tk
bo enough. This would mean a treseporteticn badget of less than -¢ 500077 . wwe?

publicity. Yhe preas arrangements ebould to carefully mde. He hoped
that someone 1 dashington could ask Br. Ronry Luca of Tine end Life

’ The thrs

+s have ranged from declarations that the communist youta would
‘drive the Nestern imperialists out cf Eerlin to outright statements that”
they would seize the Western Eerlin government and restore ‘the city to

a unified, peaceful capital of Germany. The peaceful declarations. have —
stated that the demonstration of 599,900 toys and girls (from all over ~
Germany, and froa other countries) will chiefly take place in Eastera ©
Rerlin and will consist of rally-carching; sports evects, fireworks, and
huge’ oeace’ meetings. Peraission was requested ty the FDJ, of Oberburger-
