MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Henisphere Division

SUBJECT : Raymond H. GERENDE (P) and Wife.

. 1. Raymond H. GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and con-
tract agent who has been employed by the Agency in Mexico
City since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, during which tine
he has served this Agency well, During the past fifteen
_years GERENDE has been generally engaged in the. ares of
operational support activities in Mexico City. For tae
past two years he served as a principal agent handler

for a sensitive fixed surveillance project, LIEMPTY; was
uged in unilateral recruitment approaches against the
,Cubare target; and in special support investigations.

Mrs. GERENDE, who is LIEMPTY/19, has been employed off

and on since 1958 as a support asset, (transcriber/trans-
lator) under KOC, and during’the past two yoars has worked
intermittently transcribing unilateral telephone tap tapes.

| @, During the past year GERENDE and his wife have
had serious marital problems which culminated in & sepa~
~ yYation in November 1969, and divorce actions sere initiated
- by both parties. The divorce proceedings are still in
the courts, and bitter disputes. have resulted bstween both
parties concerning custody of the children, division. of
personal property, and the ‘monetary settlements... The above
problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDB's wife knows
in. some considerable detail.of GERENDE's activities on
behalf of the A,uncy and if she exposed him, it-could lead
to the surfacing of GERENDE's -isency employment.and pos-
sible compromise of operations LIEMPTY, LINESA, LIEMBRACE,
and LIFEAT, as well as numerous individual Station assets
guch as LISTERINE, LIRAZOR/1, LIBAND/1, and David ML
WILSTED (P). Since late 1959, Mexico City Station has ey
been in touch with bot GERENDE ang hie wife om this prob- too
lem, and every effort has. been made by the Station to have

i both parties settle the divorce amicably and to protect

i GERENDE‘s cover and that of the projects. Because of the

: above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal
cover and security, he was relieved of ali operationa}.
responsibilities and placed on half salary in December 1969.

that GERENDE's personal problems were not being resolved,
and because of the continuing security threat, plans were
made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by the end of
i : FY 1970, The LiEMPTY Project reneval, approved in May

i 1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for

: GERENDE of $10,000 for 15 years of service with the agency,
and in addition approval waa received to pay re. GERENDE
the sum of $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep
her from revealing her husband's ‘wency affiliation and
wbat she knows about Agency-‘operationa in Hexico. This
project approval carried the ADDI x%aveat that the ter-
mination bonuses to both GERENDE and his wife be paid on
. B monthly basis rather than in one lump sum.as..a-security
‘measure to assure at. least an element of control over
both individuals, stace the continued receipt of these
‘monthly. payments depended on their loyalty to the Agency.
GERENDE and bis wife were terminated by Station represen-
tatives. in Mexico on 26 June 1970 under st:ndard Aveney:
“> procedures, and separate Quit Claizs and Secrecy Agros-

' Bente were siyned by both GERENDE acd. nis wife, Neither
GERENDE bor. his wife had any objection to the wording of
the Quit Clains or the Security agreements, and both
appeared to be satisfied with the terms of the settlenent,
and with the fairness of the Agency's position. .

}
' 3. In March of 1970, Mexico City Etation decided.

H

wo, «Me On B July 1970 at 1115 hours, Mra, GERENDE appeared
-at the main gate of the Headquarter's building, and requested
«tO see An. official from the Citu.  Secarity. During the
subsequent interview, Mrs. GERENDE established her identity,
and supplied the interviewer witb details on her and her
husband's past employment with the Agency ‘in Mexico City
' and the fact that they bad terminated said employment in
late June 1970. Mrs. GERENDE made three specific. requests

. “A. That she be released from the stipulation in
her secrecy agreement whicao prohibits her from revealing
her or ber husband's affiliation with the Agency, in
order that she may substantiate her husband's salary to
be awarded support payment from her husband.

"B, If her first request cannot be fullfilled,

that she be awarded a higher amount of support from the..NCE,
Agency. .

"C, If neither of the above two can be fullfilled,
that she be sent the Agency check (in present amount)
either at the address mentioned above or in care of the

In addition to the above, Mra. GERENDE stated she feels
she must permanently. leave Mexico City because of threats
made on her life by her. husband, and that sbe cannot meet

tormination, to receive the monthly payments from him.
Mrs. GERENDE has been given the phone number of the ségency
fecur'., Uuty Gfficer and her local phone number and .
address, where she is temporarily residing, was obtained.
She was advised she would be contacted within the near

7 future with an answer to her requests.

. 8, Upon receipt of the above information, Mexico City
Station was notified by cable of the situntion and. their.
comments were requosted.. The Station, on 10 July, recom-

‘mended that Headquarters hold Mra. GERENVE to her secrecy

agreement, not grant her any increase beyond the amount
agreed upon. in her termination, and proposed that she be

_ ,givon her termination paysent in one lump sum or that
; “checks ‘be mailed to her monthly.

‘6. Headquarters, in agreement with the Station's
position on the case, attempted to telephone her without
success on 18 July 1970. That same afternoon at 1400
hours, Mrs. GERENDE's brother, a naturalized U.S. citizen

‘who resides in Alexandria, Virginia, and works at Fort

Bolvoir, called the Offi.c -£ Security, using the nuxber
supplied to Mrs. GERENDE, and informed tho security
official that since Hrs. ” GERENDE had not received any
response, she expects to hear from JKLANCE by letter in
care of the Netherlands Embassy, Mexico City. :

SUBJECT: GERENDE's Wife's Visit to Washington

1. On 6 July 1970, Hr. Walt Raymond of the CA

some time in the past. Neither admits that Mr. Raymond

2, DIRECTOR 048632 was sent to the Station out-_

‘Lining this and requesting. Station's advice as to
_whether_a.Headquarters representative should meet with

GERENDE's wife. MEXICO CITY 3612 “CIN 117477) outlined

recommended against seeing her.

I discussed this matter briefly with Mr. John

ACTION BEI: od sot} .

Reference: HMMA~-38119, 18 November 1969 PRIORITY

SULDIARY

1. The LILMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence fron
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H. “GERENDE, as well as the
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERMQDE's
marital problems. Bruce H. FLENALD has been handling all Project
Personne) sinco carly December 1969, when GLuLNDE was deactivated
and placed on hali-pay, No problegs have resulted fron this, other
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to nect
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GRMNDL was). Tho security
threat will remain as long as GERINDE's estranged-wiie -has it-

; Within her power to expose GERENDE's RYROCK connection and the typo
of work he was engaged in, She has continually promised not to do

3; this, and thus far she has kept. her word, :

__,2. The LIEVPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the
Station. . It continues to play an important CI role (particularly
for LUERGO and LNREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station
is concerned, is in the positive field, ‘two recent examples
underline this: The early (and thus far only) debriefing of
AEMIDRIFE was accoaplished almost exclusively by showing hor photos
Of RLY MHARSH Habassy personnel and getting from her a character

_Bkotch on each individual, These photos were all obtained by
LILYRIC and LICALLA, Secondly, LILAPTY observations (as opposed to

photos) played an important role in our total coverice of Ai Ick
during the recent operational activity undertaken avainst AESZASICK,
In short, LIESPTY remains a highly effcctive and highly useful-.
support asset, whose product is obtained in order to be used

: operationally, not simply collccted for the files,

GEREDE

3, The GERENDE problem is unquestioncbly a serious one. We
are forwarding under separate cover copics of several wenoranda
Prepared by GERENDE. Ono outlines the history of his marital
problens, another describes the current lezal situation, and a .
third outlines proposals for a settlement. Tiere is no hope of
reconciliation, ‘The Station's position with GLLENDE from the
start has been that he must agree ‘to an anicable ecttlement with
his wife in order to insure that she would rot feel forced to take
steps which would jeopardize. the security of Station operations,

‘For this reason, the Station insisted fron the beginning that any
financial settlement with his wiie would have to take into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could eake no legal claim to that ‘
Salary, GERENDE's wite was made aware of ovr position on this, and
;she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was ‘strictly daformal, The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
“allowed to uso his KVROCK salary.as a weapon in the dispute with his
wife, because if he did, she ‘could hardly be expoéted to refrain —~
from exposing his connections, Indeed, events have shown that
GERENDE's: wife is a vindictivo woman, and if 4t had not been clear
vto her that she, as well as GEREXDZ, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for.
his pars, would have preferred to keep his RYROCK salary entirely
“out of the picture. Eventually, however, be agreed that the Station
position was' fair, and he said he would conform, .

_ 4, The attached memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
Opinion, basically fair accounts, In the beginning, the Station
: was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the
é doubt ,:argely because her description of GSRENDE's character
-  «,Weaknesses came as no Surprise (particularly his tendency to
rocrastjinate, even when his marriage was at stake). Early in the
- seonflict, LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about G:REWE's salary. She was told
,Sbe could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,
and. that if she told anyone. that GZRENDE bad any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied. and GERHNDE would. be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it
- “a meant she would have to scale: her support demands down to the
| ” level of GERENDE's overt income (GzR2NDE's nonthly salary fron

RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he e2rned an additional 4.to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly. less than 7,000 pesos monthly). no
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station. would. see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to. receive an RVROCK salary, he.
would give her the. same proportica of this salary that the courts
}determined should be paid from-his overt incone. This, of course
‘Was strictly an informal arrangezent, one which would stop the. _
minute GERENDE Stopped receiving a salary. Latér, as LimPiy-19's
‘Position hardened and her vindictiveness bégan to rule. her actions,
LIEMPTY-19 was reminded ‘by the Station that the longer. it. took for
an amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance .
that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in. having him
“arrested (which She succeeded in doing twice), his job would be’.
_Jeopardized,: While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had ‘no
. intention of causing his termination,.and had never breathed a .
I word to a soul about his RVROCK aifiliation, her attitude was. in
_ I: . -- fact jeopardizing. his job and if-he lost his job, she and.the
ty : children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income, Her attitude is

éoubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she becane- more and
more unreasonable, GERLNDE cas moving in the other direction,

5, The outcone can still not be predicted. AS can be seen
from GRRENDE's menos, the two sides are still far apart on a nuaber
A of points, including specifically money... LI TY-19 insists on
i 410,000 pesos per month, GeniiDc is willing to pay 5,009, GERiHDE

is currently or half-pay, wich mcans that his total (211 somrced

1 nonthly incone is around 14,000 pesos, From this, he would not only
havo to pay the amount which is finally agrecd upon, he nust also
continue payments oi 2560 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-l1o's father
(paying off a loan obtained to build their house), The complicating
factor is the uncertaihly of GERENDE's future with RVRUCK. The
Station has maintained for sone tine that it is impossible to —~
continue to pay GININDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
and LILYRIC basehouses, Now that FEHNALD has absorbed this duty
with onty small inconvenience and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even less sense to put GERENDE to work only to do this. GFARENDE
has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and
prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told thot he

_ would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
to retain his position, As Neadquarters is avare, he had been
given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE's
ability, As we have previously stated, he is personable, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had ood. training and expcrience

, in certain fields, On the. other hand, there has long been doubt

‘about his scriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition,

. ,fhe, “reversal of roles" which he: describes in one of the attached
“memos, which took place when he was confined to his home as an

LP keeper, did more than cause domestic probleas -= it apparently

-sdeprived hin of. the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved

reputation for boing lazy. was oarned years ago.

: 6. The question which must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE, le can. be useful to the Station, but
the Station has learned to get along without hin, What are the
security hazards involved? The gencral range of his knowledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference, If a11 of this tere blown,
the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
| -againsts the MHHARSH target, would be considerable, The Station

. does ‘not belicve that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
abuti it is impossible to predict what LIENPTY-19 might do, particularly
nce she would feel that she had nothing to lose, havicg already
lost a possible source of income through the termination, G#RENDE's
termination bonus would probably be ‘in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars, Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of ‘the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed -
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the .
two of them has never been mentioned,

LICALLA

' % ‘The LICALLA basehouse continues to fuaction without changes,
except for the fact that Bruce H. FERNALD has been- meeting LIEPTY-9
since 9 December 1969, Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are -held. once

-@ week at pre-arranged times and places (well away from the MHHARSH
‘area). . Occasionally special neetings are calléd, by .phote, by .
FERNALD, if special coverage..is desired (as in the AESEAS ICK case,
for example). There have been no problems, ‘operational or personal,
involving the basehaise or LIEWPTY-9 during the reporting period.
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reportisg period,
and -in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of

_MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested, . This
“special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected

' individual -- who-does he spend. his time with, how 4s he behaving,

specific targets, LICALLA spccial coverage can sometines give clues
to personal relationships which can be exploited, During the reporting!
period we had special coverage on AESEASICK (to determine any
changes in pattern following the AEMIDRIFF defection and following
the operation against him -- anlin both cases LICALLA aid report ~
sone change in pattern); 20)-565870 (for much the sauce. reason,
although here the evidence was not. as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather
information on bis patterns and his associations) ; ALTAKEOFF

(for the same reason); and 201-£38166 (to find out if he did,

asked to report on the arrival and activities of TDY ers such as
the ALKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that
“security inspectors" are expected == he ia told of the expected
arrival cf visitors, and he can spot a visitor,or newcomer immediately),

identify, at least by association, the person. who went out to meet
ab LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970), The
‘value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Hexico City can scarcely
‘be overstated,

LILYRIC |

8. There have been no changes during the reporting period of
the operation of the LILYRIC baschouse activity, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD took over ‘the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from
GERENDE in early December, FERNAID normally meets only LIEWPTY-13,
at pre-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MHHARSH
area), once a week for pick-up of the filns and reports. He occa-
sionally meets. LIENPTY-14 (LIz:\PTY-13's wifc) when LIENPTY-13 may
be out of town. The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays, (Extra-hour or week-end. coverage may
be: requested as necessary, and.the LILYRIC: personnel responded to. .
the ‘Station request for. such extra.coverage during the AEMIDRIFF ’
and’ AESEASICK cases.) The family has. continued to provide reports
during the reporting period.on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy. Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of MHHARSH officials,
up-to-date recording of MHHARSH license numbers, special activities
and visitors (particularly. Americans, of whon: five were spotted -and
reported on during the reporting. period), and.sone 3, 500° ‘photographs,
As an example of the value of LILYRIC“coverage, within one week of .
the. change of ‘license plates at the MHHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting all of Nexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to |

act accordingly, are another vital clement of the WTOP program.

LIMPOTY-4

9, LIEMPTY-4 bas continucd to develop and to print all of
the LICAEUA ana LILYRICS pheltographs, Ne has beea wet regularly by
Bruce H. FERNALD (taking over for GiRiNDE) since 26 Novenber 1969,
The first few meetings at that tise (late Koveaber and early
December) were arranged by FERNALD by telephene to LIED:PTY-4 and
primarily concerned LISP TY=4's reports on GEREYDK's family problens
and related security arrangements, Since nid~December,- LIELPTY~4
resuned a regular schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at
pre-arranged sites and times. LIz'PTY-4 has been given a special
extension in the Station to which he may call as "Dr. Carlos" to
leave a message for "Victor" (FEIQALD),. FURNALD can change meeting
plans by directly calling LIEMPTY-4,. The only personal problen
directly involving LIE\PTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required
his wearing a full cast on his leg for over six weeks, During
this period when LIEMPTY-4 has been unable to drive, FERNALD has
been meeting LIEMPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC filns |
‘and prints, at LIFPTY-4's office, under a suitable pretext and with
appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY-4's services are
invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis,
process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab, .

SECURITY
10.. Other than the security problems inherent in GLRENDE's

personal problems, there have been no security problems during the
reporting period,

FUTURE PLANS |

ll. As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated, This is not an easy decision to make,
4 | por will it. be.easy to confront GERENDE with this decision, He

. Phas, after’ all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK. However,

i as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able.
to. getealong without his services. Furthernore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.
To try to molify her. by promising her a portion of his salary is
‘ probably unworkable in realistic terns, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened, The Station, therefore,
intends tp terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970, GERENDE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per
full year. This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons,
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by .
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be |
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD). Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY=19 of -
the termination, | and, to keep her from revealing what she knows, *-
she will undoubtediy’ have to be given some money herself, The | -
Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound fron
‘a security point of view to use the money which GFRENDE himself has
earned for this purpose. Therefore, while the figure will renain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD) -
would be a reasonable amount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in.

the LIESPTY Project are currently estimated at Slightly less than
$33,000 (USD). The Project has been approved in the amount of
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It
is therefore requested that the LIZUPTY Project. be amended for ~
FY. 1970 to provide an additional $§,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

LICALLA, LILYRIC, ard LIENFTY-4 are concerned, to changes in
procedure are planned. The product is useful, it. is as tinely a3
present circunstances permit, and tho personnel involved are doing

‘ Salary for somo, if not all, of these agents, The nost reccot
‘salary increases took effect in May 1968, LUUuP7Ty-4 has not had
an inerease since January 1967, and ‘LIEMPTY-15. since Janunry 1964,
Increase in cost of Living alono would be sufiicient justification
to raise salaries, but in the ease of these agents their consistently
excellent work deserves to be rewarded, These salary increases
will probably range between 10 and 20 percent,

13. As for other project expenses, LIENPTY-10 and LIEYPTY~11
“ will no longer be funded under LIEMPTY, but have been transferred
3 to LIEMBRACE effective 1 July 1970. Real estate expenses should

inflation, The rent on GEREXDE's dark room (MEXI 137) will no
longer be paid with his termination, MV-2823 will be. sold or
otherwise disposed of and. showld not be included in tho project

fo ——* r realize that the: interests ot the organization: and the

: interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in

_ possible in the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartmentation and efficiency prescribe the mcedue

i operandi and, to a great extent the wodus vivendi, of agency

{ pexsonael net only in the sense of earning a living but also in

!- manner.of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private

handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the

risks it has entailed, I feel that some explanation is necessary.

For Your Information

REFERENCE : HNMA-27623 , 4 August 1969 Cast Progress Report)

1, Although this report might normally be submitted one month
from now, the use of-Oliver G, SCANTLING. kas shifted sufficiently
to warrant a special report at this time. Our next progress report

- will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December un-
less exceptional circumstances justify another change.

2. Tho fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who has
suifered tho past six weeks from paratyphoid) is that he. has been
divorced from routine cut-out operations and will henceforth be
used for priority tasks and targets which will better utilize his
proven talents. First, in late September ZARBOCK took over LICASA-1
Sor direct handling. The LICASA operation offered no particular
challenge to SCANTLING and it is doubtful that his intermediary role
offered any particular additional security in this case. In fact,
if a flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add
one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the
GON. Second, it has been decided that SCANTLING will very. soon turn
LIANVIL-~1 over to Raymond GERENDE, The details are presently being
_worked out, ———— .

3. PLANS: In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for: re-
cruitment efforts principally (and less so for routine egent handling)
, he is presently preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject ‘of
2% MEXICO CITY-1502. When that operation is completed he will be tar-
geted against the MIHARSH target both through a commercial outlet of
the Bloc and through various clubs and sparts centers where he may
have access to KHHARSH types. Aside from these responsibilities, he
will be used-as needed-in other recruitment situations ‘especially in.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer, Western Hemisphere

Division
VIA : WH/FI 4
WH/CONTRACTS ,
: Recommendation to Amend the Contract of

SUBJECT A
: . Raymond H. GERENDE (Contract Agent) to
Include Improved Termination Benefits
and a Salary Increase , .

. 1. During the past year Mexico City Station has
submitted several dispatches recommending that paragraph
11 of Subject's contract be amended to include new benefits
in the event of Subject's termination and/or resignation
from Agency service, These Station recommendations have
been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a Memorandum
was’ forwarded to C/WH/1 containing guidance on the suggested
contract amendment. .

8, The. above. information has been reviewed again by
AC/WII/1,. and we are requesting approval for the following’
amendments to paragraph 11 of Subject's contract:

“ “A) -In the event of GERENDE's termination by the
“ Agency he will receive three month's pay plus one

-_ month's pay for every full year of service since

' 18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at
‘the time of termination. - cos : .

-B) In the event of resignation and/or. voluntary .

" retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule
would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best
interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment
as follows: :

. (1) Less than 15 years service (prior to March -
' 1870) 20 days pay for each full year of service.

ole. (2). Over 15 years: service, but less. than 20
-years service (prior 18 March 1975) three months

Salary plus 20 days: pay for ‘each full year of: service.

i
iL
i
'
¥
z



--- Page 97 ---
(3) Over 20 years service, three months

salary plus one month's Pay for each full year
of service, .

(4) All payments above are to be calculated
at the rate of pay applicable at the time of
retirement and/or resignation,

3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their
Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note
the following: : : ,

A). GERENDE is a Mexican citizen, working for the
Agency since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, who considers
himself to be a "career" employee of the Agency, and
whose initial local employment for cover. purposes was
largely notional under a system of “ghost payrolling".
GERENDE received no income or benefits from this "cover"
position which terminated due to the demise of the
company on 31 December 1967.. GERENDE's other "cover"
is self generated in that he gives English lessons in
his spare time to middle management Mexican nationals
employed by American owned companies in Mexico City.
His income benefits from this "cover" are minimal, but
suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source
of his income. In conclusion, GERENDE is considered by
vy the Station to be a full time contract agent, on call
os at all times for operational activity. Any other local
: benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of. his’
being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern
of this Agency given the above circumstances of his employ-
ment with us. . : De

4- This Branch is of the belief that the resignation
‘and/or retirement schedule outlined in Paragraph 2, B above
Provides career benefits for GERENDE in. the event that he.
must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal
circumstances, It additionally rewards him for his loyalty.
of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive
. to remain in Agency service for the additional financial

benefits that will accrue to him providing both future
security and incentive. . ee :

. The Field Station will be queried for their approval via

5. During the past two years GERENDE has served as
a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed sur-
veillance project; has carried out, unilateral recruitment -

‘approaches against the Cuban target; has been used in

special support investigations; and is presently being
considered for use in special operations of a sensitive

mature. .A review of the progress reports. in. GERENDE's

operations discloses that the. Station has been more than
satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to

take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's last.
salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per-annum was granted :
in July 1965, and there have been no increases since, ~~ i
Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over. : :
amendment of paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract has been :
in progress for over one year and a half, we are of the i
bélief that thé Station wished ‘to ‘finalize this amendment :
prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent. - It

is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval ij
be given for a salary increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef- }
fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.

EH. GERENDs's contract, it occurred to us that it would prebably. be
useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERLNDE'S cover status.
As a full-time contract agent, GERUNDS is on call at all times tor
operational activity, His cover activity not only provides him wito
the necessary flexibility, it is alsv solid enough to provide him
with a plausible explanation of his existence and his income,

. 2, GERENDE has two major cover activities, One is the teaching
ot English, mainly to middle-manayement personnel of American-owned
. firms in Yexico City, This is done on a regular basis for a few ok
hours’ each day and carns GERENDE an income of about 5000 pesos per
cionth, His second cover activity, and-one which is largely a sever
‘“tand not really activity, 4s working as a salesman for IDEN AT GERENDS|
yactually earns only about 500 pesos per month from this, but this tact
is a closely guarded secret. GERINDK'S acquaintances assume-that a
‘. good part of his income comes {rom this cover, Previously, GERENDE
UR had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,
B e ostensibly fron IDEN 3. IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years |-
| “he had carried GERENDE on his payroll as an independent salesman on
vu commission, He would ostensibly pay GERENDE 2 certain amount of
"money, and IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and
‘social security based on this alleged payment. IDEN B would also
pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed, This

Bystem of "ghost payrclling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody
gains: the company because its declared profit is lower than it
really is and, therefore, subject to less tax, and the individual

' because he is ordinarily given a kickback for allowing his name to
be used (or in GzRENDL's case, because it. provided cover).

3. . All this ended on 31 December 1967, when LISTERINE sold
IDEN B to IDEN A. For a while thereafter, GERENDE paid taxes ocaly
on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,
about 500 pesos per month, As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE
arranged, at GERENDE's request, to have his accountant (who continued
to handle GERENDE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to lump together
@11 of GERENDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A) as
“professional earnings" and to file returns for-GERENDE which included
the total amount. This is not quite as satisfactory as the old
arrangement (among other things GERENDE must now pay his owa taxes)
but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate. Other than LISTERINE
and the accountant, no one knows. that GERENDE's ostensible earnings
have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the. only person
who is aware of GERENDE's tie with WOFIRM,

2, First, Ref B raised the point that there had been no efficiendy
reports written on _GERNENDE or “evidence of outstanding periormance,."
“GERLNDE's performance has been evaluated regularly within the context
of ‘the regular LIZYPTY Project progress reports, and a review of the
past several reports will demonstrate that the Station has been more
.than satisfied with GERLND#'s performance and is anxious to take
advantage ot his full potential, Tne Station docs not believe,

prerequisite for the type of contract amendment being requested... It .
is perfectly true, as pointed out in Ref B, that the Station had gone.

bonus if he should resign sinply to ret the extra money or to pursue

undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service with a
- generous termination payment, He has earned it, and only termination
pe cause per paragraph 10 (b) of his conisact would prevent nim

et ASMie ations tomas tee

from receiving it.

3. Mexican law (it is the law, not custom) says that-an employee

who is fired nust be paid three months" salary plus twenty days'

Salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate

‘existing at the time of separation. GiRENDE'S current cover. company
adheres to this formula. Since GfRENDi's termination clause has
always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for. every
year of service (in the event of his termination ty WOFIRM), we would
not want to change that, and in fact we wish to ac¢ to it the three
mnonths' pay guaranteed by Mexican law, At the save time, we do see
some. virtue in the suggestion in parapraph 3 of Ref B that tull
retirement benefits (in the event of GERENDE'S resignation) would
apply only aiter 20 years' service, with lesser benefits until then,
Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to
15 full years of service (i.e. prior to 18 March 1370) he be paid
twenty days' salary for each rull year, that aiter 15 years but prior
to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full months’ salary, and that
aiter 20 years he be paid three months' salary plus one months' salary
for every full year, It is true, of course, that Mexican law does
not make any provision for payment of a terminatice bonus to an

. employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort
of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out, “working
for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional financial
consideration," In the case of GERENDE, we are not attempting to
establish any pattern. This is a special case (as are most) and the
Station:merely wishes to insure that GERENDE, who has made WOFIRM a
career without: receiving any career benefits in return, is rewarded
for his loyalty and is given some incentive for the future, GERENDE
Is not without his’ faults, and he is being adequately compensated for
the work he performs, but we cannot expect to get nore out of him
without showing bim greater respect,

?

4. The Station requests, therefore, that the following amendment
ibe made in paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract: : :

a. In, the event of GERENDE's termination by WOFIRM, he will
receive three months' pay plus. one month's pay for every full
year: of.service since 18 March 1955, calculated at the rate
applicable at the time of termination,

b. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be

accepted by WOFIRM as being in its best interest, and GERENDE:
‘will be eligible for terminai payment according to the following

. formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERENDE will receive. 20 days*
pay for every full year of service since 18 March 1955; after 18
March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GERENDE will receive
three months! pay plus 20 days for every full year since 18
March 1955; Giter 18 March 1976 GERENDE will receive three months"
pay plus one month for every full year of service since 18.March
1955, All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable
at the time of resignation. : :

5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force.
6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another

year without change. We assume that this has been done, although we
have not been notified. : “

2. During the reporting period, tne case officer. has been
meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings
are. usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times, Meetings

_ average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case
officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he. has
picked. up from the base houses Since the previous meeting,:
along with brief contact reports on his meetings with base
house. representatives, Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc~
tions, notes: for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge-
ments which may be desired by the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting, (The departure
of. LIACUTE-l1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber. As a temporary solution, pending ‘the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber, -
GERENDE'’s wife, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes. She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the
tapes.) : re

3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: . LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; met
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per_week. until
termination); LIEMPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per week -- in his absence LIEMPTY=+27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). Ho is
an responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling

- 8 all of the administrative problems which may develop,. To judge
from the resultS, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents.
and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from. .
them <= particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel, oe ie

e

i
i

4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the ..
Mexican: MHRAVEL committee, which we found.a useful side benefit,
His MHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal, ~
but we expect it to start picking up again. GERENDE has con~—
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and wo have instructed him to try to get .
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL :
delegation as possible. : an : :

5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had perforned
nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational |
lead, and that the Station planned to. give GERENDE more of the ~
same, .Furthermore, GERENDE'S standing assignments (LIEMPTY ——
base houses, MHRAVEL activity, and occasional support oi J}ROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough
of GERENDE’s time. -GERENDE. is. rather firmly. committed to .
WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOFIRM for
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.
consequence. By the same token, he was, through no fault of
his own, doing less work for WOFIRM than at any time in. his
career, GERENDE'S operational exposure through the years _
dicta. - eo OnS_On His activity,.-for sound |
securi . The solution. to GERENDE’S problem (lackor
a pronising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's -.
worth) seemed to be to give GERENDS additional tasks which he
could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security
precautions, Since most of GERENDS'S support activities had
_ been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to

be taken in committing him further in this direction, It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling. would be in
a non-FJSTEAL field. : . : =

G. In line with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced
to Andrew R. DOSCHER on 17 February 1968. The idea was that
GERENDE would be trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations against Central American targets. GERENDE's principal
duty thus far has been to taze over tho handling of ERFAIN-~-3,
under DOSCIHER's close supervision and guidance, GERENDE has
performed quite creditably in this task. . He seens interested
in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting, If GERLNDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be cvery reason
to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler,

7. GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing

(in alias) a girl who, por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT, Although GERENDE had to be. continually reminded of the
assignnent, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and

. Gaining her confidence, It is quite likely that he cquld have
recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODINT, but as
this. point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt. that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least
(among other things, there was no indication that she bad had
any contact with AERODENT fer some months). The only flaw in-
GERENDE’s performance was the time it took him to get around ‘to
doing the job. It should be mentioned, however, that at the
same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal-matters to
attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though -
construction is still not entirely completed, | a

8. Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the ao
reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a
listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian Looe
translator working. for the MBRAVEL committee, a .

‘Reference: HMET 8751 :

1. Before amending GERENDE’s contract in accordance sith
reference, we would like to clarify a few points about GERENDE
and about terminations and resignations in general.

2. We assure. fron the. files that GERENDE' perforuance has

- been entirely satisfactory but since there are no efficiency re-
ports or actual evidence of outstanding performance, we would

_ Vike to have a statement fros the station which would justify. the

13571 that "station would not want to give GERENDE a terainal
payment 1f he elects to resign just to receive some extra money
or to parsue sone other career." That was a long time ago, bowv-
ever, and thirteen years of loyal collaboration may very vell
have changed your sind on this point. —

4. Could you recapitulate for us the prevailing Mexican. law.
or custom. (which ts it?) oa ternination-at- the-convenience-of-the-

months pay plus 20-days-per-year-worked, but the LIFIRE/4 and 5
MOC's said tht. "following local custom of termination subject only
bas to be paid one month's salary for each year of employment",
Your propused GEKENDE terminal payment formula, (which may be a
special case rather than a pattern and which, as've understand it,
pokes no distinction between voluntary. resignation and teraination-
at-the-conventence-of-the-employer) is one month's pay for each —.
full year of employeent, plus three montha pay at the rate applic»
able at the tine of termination. Does this imply: that the one. -
wonth's pay for each year worked is.conputed at the rate of pay pre-
vailing during each respective year worked? Does Mexican lav or

custom dictate the payment of terminal bonus to euployees who resign |

voluntarily? (Working for WOFIRM is a very. special case, obviously,
and deserves exceptional financial consideration, but we do want to
understand the background ag it applies to commercial work so that
we may have a ‘frame of reference or point of ‘departure) ~

It was originally written in March, and mislaid in transit, but we
thought it had been pouched. —
