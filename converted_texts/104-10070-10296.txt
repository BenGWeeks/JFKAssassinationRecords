and

b. Whether he would in fact employ the agent |and send

clusion of his pertod of training,

Mr, Cherne replied that unfortunately the latter was impoasible
inasmuch as his company did not send personnel overseas in any capacity,
As regards the immediate backstopping of the agent's} story, however,

Mr. Cherne said that he would be happy to oblige for a period of train-
ing only, to wit, three months, after which other cover would have to
be sought. Mr. Cherne requested that he be furnished at an early date
with more.complete information as to what was to be expected of hin
