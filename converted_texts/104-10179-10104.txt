availaile, in case of an emergency, to help in eatting up sone kind of
provisional government; and (3) to have his general views on the poseibility.

Since 1 had arranged to return to Washington on the same day, I did
net give Ray muck vie to do a thorough jot. However, he was able to
furnish me with a list of names, covering pointe (1) and (2). He promteed
to provide me with auditional irformatien after checking with some of his
