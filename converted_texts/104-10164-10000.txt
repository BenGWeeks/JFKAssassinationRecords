WH/COG (x-1325), copies of (1) w secrecy agreement (in Spanish) .

and (3) a tormination secrocy oath signed by Bernard L. Barker 7
dated 12 August 1966. Copics of those documents are attached. |

2. After discussing the matter with Mr, Navid Phillips,
C/WH Division, I prepared the 18 April fettor adding the socond
Sentence of the first paragraph at the request of Mz. Joo Skura,
AG/WH/CCG («-1948). After completing the latter, 1 coordinated
it on 15 April 1974 with Mr. Skura and agreed to vend him a copy

their association with the Agency. I explained the Agency's serious
reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and
operations that are still in being. 1 explained that the Agency con-
tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom
Messrs, Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency
association. Mr..Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem, Thus,

in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the

Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and
Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they
had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily
acknowledged those conditions. . .
4. I mentioned to Mr. Schultz that if, as a result of the
discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes
that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a
narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee
that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider

_ at in view of (!) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offer as to his

nends, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current
operations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-
donce of current and po‘ontial Agency relationships. .

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD ; ; :

SUBJECT: Request from OGC for Signed Copy of Bernard h
BARKER's Contract

1. On 18 April 1974 Mr. Dietd of OGC asked if I had

been able to lscate a signed copy of Bernard Barker's contract

which we were unable to locate a few days ago. The answer

was no. I took advantage of Pepe Palmer's presence at Has.

on TDY to ascertain whether a signed copy of BARKER's contract
‘muld possibly /at G2 Station WH/Miami. Pete said with

certainty there was no signed copy at Station WH/Miami since

much of the material at the Station had been destroyed, Also,
. @ince BARKER was terminated in mid-1966, the Station tile

should have been transferred to Hqs. back then.

we 2. I passed the foregoing informaton *o Mr. pieta’
‘who simply asked that I doubie check with WH/Contracts and

Acting Chief of Station, JMWAVE!
Opera tiona

._ x AMCLATTER/1 Progress Report: October-December 1965

1. During the reporting period AMCLATTER/1 has continued
to serve as contact point for matters pertaining to Cuban exile
activities and related affairs of possible CI interest. He has
maintained his large number of contacts within the Cuban exile
community, contacts representing suci varied sectors as exile
political leaders, officials of exile organizations, former mem-
bers of the police force, as well as suspected underworld char-
acters. AMCLATTER/1's close relationship to Identity A has ~
resiilted in a number of reports which were of interest to other :
Station components and some of which were disseminated. - AMCLATTER/#
is at his best when asked to furnish information about individuals
in the WAVE area who may be of operational interest to the Station;
he pursues such assignments with the zeal of a trained bloodhound,
combing his many and various contacts for information and ‘rarely
coming up with a negative report. AMCLATTER/1 works diligently
and likes to be kept busy. It is preferable to give AMCLATTER/1
highly specific and detailed instructions, which he will then
follow to the letter. When left to his own devices he will at
times not use the best operatiors! judgment, which is usually
the result of over-zealousness and expediency rather than lack
of operational know-how or experience,

2. In November 1966, with the increase in the refugee
fiow, the CI Branch. began using the services of AMCLATTER/1
in interviewing refugeca of interest to this Branch and. pra=
paring debriefing reports. In this respect he ia performing
the samo kind of work ae members of the AMSERVE Team, However,
because of his continuing reporting on Cuban exile matter, hie
many contacts within this community, and the fact that he ia

community, &t was decided not to incorporate AMCLATTER/1 into
the AMSERVE Unit but rather continue running him as a singleton
agent. lt was also felt that he resportls more favorably under
the direction and guidance of one case officer rather than as

a@ taam member. AMCLATTER/1 has performed very well in his new
duties aa refugee debriefer, and his debriefing reports are
models of thoroughness, if not of organization. .

3.. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/1
conducted a total of 16 refugee debriefings and: prepared reports
on these. Some of the debriefings required as many.as four
separate sessions. In addition, AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten

‘number of threatening phone calls from someone who spoke fluent

ome /euta (w/KDRN we/ey toc.)

x

1. AMCLATTER/1 reported on 19 April 1965 that he had received
that same evening a total of four phone calls from an unidentified
party threatening to kill both his wife and himself.

2. The first three phone calls were received between 1800 and
1830 hours whsveas the fourth call was received at 2130 hours. The
caller spoke fluent English and used extremely vile language insult-
ing to both A/1 and his wife. The .conversation during each phone
call was short and made no sense to.A/l who said the caller at one
point identified himself as Jerry WWALKER when A/1l asked who was
speaking. A/1 has never heard of nyone by this name and believes
it to be fictitious. The caller also said on one oceasion, "Ive
been hearing the things you said about me up in Fort Lauderdale."
Again, this remark made no sense to A/l, «Au. Threatening prove cahls

: Veeusyed by % /- As ;

3. A/1, when offered by hie JMWAVE-C70: ode non
room or safehouse for the evening, said that he appreciated our
offer but was armed with a 38 caliber revolver and could take care
of himself. He said that his wife and 18 year old daughter agreed
with him about staying in. their awn house since they had fled their

home once »efore in PBRUMEN and did not intend to run again. A/1l

is of the opinion that the caller ia & crank but has not ruled
out the possibility that 14t may be PBRUMEN intel inspired: He -
said that one of his friends (IDEN) also had recently received a
Spanish but revused to identify himself by name,
