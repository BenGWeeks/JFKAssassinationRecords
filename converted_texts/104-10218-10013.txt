Interview of Mr,
ALTHO RESIZED - REFERENCES,

See paragraph | below.

1, Your assistance is requested in interviewing the Salvadorian citizen,
Lais E, GUTIERREZ, for information whicls would be helpful to this Government
in determining the accuracy of certain claims made confidentially by
Herbert L. ITKIN. Mr. ITKIN is a prime witness in legal proceedings presently
underway in New York Cit: involving the Mafia and related underworld organiza-
tlone, ITICIN lives under the protection of U.S. Federal Marshals. .

2. The following data is for your information, It should not be used in
dealing with GUTIERREZ or outside of this Crganization, ITKIN hss been an

| FBI informant since March 1963, He has now claimed to have worked for this

. Organization during the period 1954/55 to 1965. ITIKKIN asserts that his contact
during these yeare was one Philip HARBIN. This inquiry is concerned solely
with ITKIN's claimed relationship with this Crganization fram 1954/55 to 1960
when he alleges HARBIN was his contact. As will be seen, GUTIERREZ, ITKIN
alleges, also knew HARBIN during that time azc that fact, therefore, is
material to the credibility of ITKIN's story.

ITHIN's first contact with Philip HARBIN wae in 1955 when he claims to
have beea comtactcd purevant to a mecting be, ITKIN, had in Philadelphia with
a leading personality of this Organization and ancther high-goverument official
late in 1954 or early 1955. According to ITKIN, HARBIN never made the
specific claim of being from thia Organization but that was ITKIN's aseumption.

- FYYKIN describes HARBIN as about 42 or 43 {in 1955), an Amsrican,
He had receding heir, combed back but parted. He was about 5'8" in height,

Following an initial-mecting, ITHIN atleces thst he aud NARDIN ict
periodically in New York City. ITKIN alleges that he passed to HARBIN copies

of the correspondence developed by his law firm, Delson, Levin and Gordon,
dealing with Indonesia, Burma, and India, ITKE! left that law firm in mid-1957,
presumably thereby losing total access. Among the materials ITKIN claims he
passed to HARBIN before he left the Delson, Levin and Gordon firm was informa-
tion he picked up from: = fricaz who worked at the United Nations for the
Government of El] Salvador, This friend waa Luis E, GUTIERREZ (see biographic
eketch, Attachment A). ITKIN claims that he became very friendly with
GUTIERREZ, who was studying either at New York University or Columbia

where he prepared a master's thesis on El Salvacor's economic position.

HARBIN, he says, was interested in the topic and ITKIN alleges he furnished
HARBIN notes of GUTIERREZ' monograph,

 ceencnyengean peepee a+

Sometime presumably after mid-year 1957, HARBIN asked ITKIN if he
knew anybody else who could do (intelligence) work, ITKIN recalled GUTIERREZ,
who meanwhile had moved to;the position as Consul General of El Salvador in.
New Crieans, Louisiana, HARBIN--ITKIN says--accepted the suggestion and
ITKIN provided an introduction for HARBIN by letter, which he sent to GUTIERREZ
in New Orleans, ITKIN asserts that HARBIN--according to his.own statement--
went to New Orleans and made the "new contact". ITKIN claims he last saw
HARBIN in 1960,

compe bernie nen»

3. A comparison between the key points of ITKIN's account as surmmarized
in the immediately preceding. paragraph with the data set out in Attachment A and
E will show immediate contradictions that tend to destroy any credibility in
ITKIN's account, particularly with respect to his relationship to GUTIERREZ.

We also point out, solely for your information, that we have found no confirnia- be
tion in our records of any relationship between this Organization and: ITKIN luring
the period 1954-1960, No traces have been found in our records or anywhere aoe
government thus far of a Philip HARBIN, and there is explicit denial that there was|
any meeting in Philadelphia in 1954 between ITKIN and the high officials he
nominates, Finally, there is no substantiation in our files of any of the intelli-
gence product which ITKIN allegedly passed to HARBIN. This case, however, is
of such a nature that we must strive, if possible, to have GUTIERREZ' own
statement for the record,

4. We leave to the Station determination of the best manner to approach
GUTIERREZ, It is our preference that a Station officer, under suitable cover,
perform the interview, but it may well be that a consular or embassy officer
might be the best person to do the job, We repeat that we are concerned in this
matter solely with the verification or denial of ITKIN's statements, specifically
the allegation that he introduced HARBIN to GUTIERREZ in New Orleans and
that as a consequence GUTIERREZ would be in a position to identify and describe
HARBIN in a way that would permit us to locate him if he exists. The request
for GUTIERREZ’ assistance in this matter is inno way predicated upon hostility

_ towards ITKIN nor is there any predisposition against his claims if indeed et
evidence is found to back them up. If GUTIERREZ indicates that he is willing to
provide whatever information he can, you can assure him that his information is
solely for U.S, Government use and will not be made public by us at any time
without his expressed consent. Also, it is clear that we are prepared to © accept

" his decision to give no assistance in the matter.

5. We have compiled a a short Statement that might be used by the interviewer
to explain to GUTIERREZ, the purpose of the interview, (see Attachment B), A list
of questions, which should: ‘be given orally, ia claborated in: Attachment C. -You
will note that these questions cencern the larger as well as narrower elements. |
of GUTIERREZ! relations with ITKIN. Wa are wiliing to cettle for a specifie ©
answer to the narrower question of Philip HARBIN: in preference to generalizations
about the whole relationship, If, as a consequen ‘of your handling, GUTIERREZ
is willing to talk in depth; we will be grateful. re .

one of the completed federal cases in New York City. This item is attached for
your background reading, This may be shown to GUTIERREZ, of course,
‘Attachment E is a copy of a letter dated 26 February 1965 from GUTIERREZ to
ITKIN, Again, the content of this letter tends to support the theory that iTKIN's
story, as elaborated in paragraph 2 above, is 2 fabrication, While possibly based
on a real relationship, it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology
and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved. Also included in this
attachment is ITKIN's anewer to the letter, We feel in retrospect that
GUTIERREZ might be unhappy to read his own letter in the course of a consular
interview, We, therefore, suggest that this not be shown to him. However,
there is no objection to an indication that the U.S, Government is aware that
GUTIERREZ was in perfectly correct correspondence with ITKIN during 1965 on
business matters, ‘

7, We would appreciate compliance at your earliest convenience and a pre-
liminary indication by cable of GUTIERREZ‘ response, if one is forthcoming, on

the questions concerning GUTIERREZ! knowledge of HARBIN, If there is anything
unclear in this dispatch, Headquarters would welcome any questions by cable,
All correspondence should be addressed Chief, WOMUSE, via Chief, WH.

Mp. Norbert Itxin, . . : . ba
300 Nadison Avo., state :
Now Yoru City, N.Y. -

Doar Heroy:

It was a rosl good surprico to receive your letter of
Pebruary 15, 1965.'T nad written you tvico in the last three years,
and I had no answer. I wont to New Yor to wie C.I.0. Convention
in Septonbor 1963; thon I looxod for you every where, but I found
you nozi.cro. So = realizod thas you had cisapeared from New York

and moved co another place. Hut what a rolief now;; You still are ~ oe
in the Empire State kicking around and tninzing about your oid
frionds.

As you probably rexembor we ¢o not see each othor since |
19522 Let me give you a rough breifing on what happens during this |
timo. In Novembor 1952 I wus appointed Consul General of £1 Salvador
. at New Orloans; in 1958 I rosignod und come back to ny country and
a . Was appoirniod Comptrolor of tho Bans Inspecting Bureau; then in
ne 31960 I was anyointed Gonoral Director of the Social Security Bureau.
bop . thor. 2a 1962 I moved to private business as Genoral Manacer of
Fe INVERSIONES COVERCIALES, S.A., o small insurance coxmpenye Among some
of my prosont extra activitios, I em: a) monoer of the City Govern- .
ment (City Commissioner); b) remsor of theacdvimry Eoard of the
. Central Bark and c) Profassor of Economics cond Business Laragement
. . at tho School of Enginoering of the University of El Salvador.

Althouch, as you can see, I cm in the Hizh Brass category
I dolong at the sano time to the low income oracket group. For that
roason i have doen looxing for a more juicy dusiness, but so far T
havo found nothing. That is way I woula say you aro just on tine
“4. Offering mo to do some businoss with you. I hope you will write and
tell me more about what you heve in mind. Also I will be waiting for
you in April or any othor time; the sooner <ne bettere a

. There is something elso I must tell youe I want to go
back to New York and I ncood your help v tadly.s You know that in
order to work in tha OS Gnd MUST have & resident visa and to
odtainoé such visa ono must have an afficavis from an American Citi~

_ 20%6 Could you bo so Kind giving me such a help? I kope you will aay *
Yes. : > .

Had he been in charse of the EV Vi effert, the peasants would have
rallied to the invading forces, but they will not ce so to s force

3. IDEN-A's carp is still in existence in the [PR and contains
abeut 70 wen at present. Anong these are EVLUTE/4 and Uenvi Clerreat.
Ne said that EVLUTE/4 is able but soxewhat erratic and he (IMUN-A)
fears that he would accept support {rer any source including the ~
Corrunists, thourh he knows that EVLUTE/4 is not himself a coirunist.
—Yie likewise mistrusts the EVLUTE group because it s leadcersnip is too
far to the Jeft. Again, he docs not believe that the rerbers of :
LLVLUTE are themselves Cormmists, but they atterpted to obtain suppert :
fron Yexican Cosrunists. . *

4. IDEN-A concerned at the roncnt in obtainins support te enable

thus placing an intelersble burden on his slim resources, Ile needs a
few thousand deilars fem food supziies and hopes to pet sove help in
New York £rem CARE or sore other philanthropic orcanization. .

S. IDEN-{ regrets the overthrow ef the Bosch severnzent. Tle says
that he is avare of 8osch's shortconings as an adcinistrator, but that
he had the interests of the Dominican Republic at heart and had °
demonstrated his sympathies for IDEN-A and his {ollowers.
