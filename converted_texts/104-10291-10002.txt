to ‘bring .to your attention and add my strong’ concurrence

\. . and recommendation to two (2) recorded Fecomiendations for

i oa . find it hard to imagine 4 more persuasive. Fecommendation ©
for this action: than that forwarded. by my predecessor in :
i ; June 1969 (Attached). I can imagine Mr. Mitchell's feeling © ~~ “
_ H . When he prepared the sccond recommendation “in February 1970, © so —
of . (Attaehed).. And yet, I find in; February: 1971 there has still ”
Hq . : been no action. In the year that has: passed this promotion
has. becomo even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-
: Appointnont accompanying Such a continuing lack of recogni-
i tion, thero has been no diminution of entliusiasm, no lowering
; of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed because
: ef his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen-
dations not so clearcut and deseriptive, I would conclude
; . that those in control simply do not know what this officer
a does. and has done. Knowing what he does and how he docs it
i should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my.
Strongest recommendation for early and favorable action.

shoule. be ny preference I believe that for ma to leave my cur-
rent.assignment at this time for even one year would not be in
the best intcrests of either KU:MRK or ODYOKE. Therefore, I’
requost home leave, with approximately one monti-at Headquarters
for requested training and refresher work and one month of leavo, .

‘returning to current: assignment Jor ot least an additional to-

year tour with the provis no that after the first yx the situae
tion be reecxamined with the ultimate view of pos bly at that
point. consivoring a two-yemr tow at Headquarters

7], In’ my years in n work on dapan, approximately ¢ ten of

ich hava been spent, ‘consecut. vely in Japan, I feel that I

have been able to provide a certain degree of ‘intelligence con-
tinuity which could be spetled by a tvo-year break. Realizing

thet career-wise I should spand at least one tour at Headquarters :
in the Niture, T believe that, despite ossible reflections
