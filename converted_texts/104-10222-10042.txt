MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-4 -

:

Charlotte Bustos-Videla

l tis recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted
from GS-13 to GS-14,

2, The performance of this officer has been characterized for
many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-
standing, She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in.
each Headquarters Branch or Field Station asd gnment, usually
functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned, Since return
to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,
her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the
Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and
growth potential, She is currently chief of-the Cuban and CA Section
of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her
assigned duties, She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet
imaginative officer greatly appreciated by her supervisors, In
short, she is a true professional who performs beyond her gerade level.

8. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency
since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and adyancing
brilliantly with each new challenge offered, She achieved protessional
Status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing
in Latin American affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments,
a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise
and thorough production, A review of her carecr to date can lead to the
conclusion that she has always risen successfully to each new
professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum
capacities, While she has had little supervisory experience in the
field, her supervisor was of the-ophion that she is a "natural leader",
This has been borne out in her‘perfermance in her current capacity
as a Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary
supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and
professional aplomb, She is a popular co-worker, is receptive to guidance
and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates,

4, This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language
to maximum advantage in her work, Formal testing recently confirmed
her high proficiency in that language. Coupled with a comprehensive -
training record and her Invaluable experiences over a twenty year
period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American
operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each
of several recognized specializations, including CI operations,
functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied

covert action activities,

5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and overa
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal troubleshooter, Her duties included the maintenance of
watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw
technical take, target analysis, reports writing, operational support,
handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the
Chief of Station's Executive Assistant,

6. The employee is occasionaliy called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending In December 1972,
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job ts felt sorely by the
Branch, I is expected that her current assignment wil Lost about

two years,

7, Us summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has
been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now
tIme to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance

and which she so justly deserves,

history and current career-field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System, In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of hia

tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
docs not meet the basic requirements of IIR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board,
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting thia screening 1

of qualify service as required by regulatton. My determ{nation that you

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS (Panel A) -

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-13
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla,
- rt

1, The promotion to. GS-13 of Mrs, Charlotte Bustos-Videla
is recommended. Mrs. Rustos-Videla entered the Agency in
August 1951 as a GS-5 and rapidly and deservedly rose to a
GS-12 grado by 1959, .

2, This recommendation is based on Mrs, Rustos-Videla's
performance during the past three years as the senior assist-
ant to the various chiefs of the Mexican desk/branch, who
unanimously have found her to be extremely competent and re-
liable both in her routine assignments and special tasks
occasionally levied on her, such as country studies, compila-
tion of programs, requirement reviews, etc, .

3, Mrs, tustes-Videlw hes consistently responded with
intelligence and clarity and bes materially centributed to
orderly imaginative administration of Headquarters support to
a most active station. In the-precess, she has been instru-
wental in training on-the-job innumerable officers both for
desk assiynments and in preparation for field assignments.

4, For her outstanding performance sho racelved a quality
step increase in April 1964. This deserved recognition should
now be followed un at this time by a promotion to the next
grade in accordance with the consistently good performance at
the GS-13 level over a prolonged period of time,

1, Iam pleased to send to you the attached official notification
of the approval of the Quality Step Increase which you recommended |
for this employee,

2. The salary increase accomplished by the award of a Quality.
Step Increase is important and tangible evidence of the esteem in
which the employee so recognized is held, However, I believe the
commendatory and incontive benefits of this award will be partially
lost unless it is presented in an appropriate ceremony which will
afford the individual recognition among co-workers and supervisory
officials, ‘Also, I believe such recognition serves to inspire other

eiployeas to aspire to eating such recoraitioan,

In the 8 months during. which she wag under my supervision, Mrs. Bustos has
performed in.that-same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become
her trademark. over the years, She understands the intelligence process from
start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the
agent handling aspects. She excels in each phase of the work,

As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activities section; she has once again
demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties, Stie is a sound, dependable,
yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves Little

to,be desired. While.she had had little previous supervisory experience, she has
in this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability. Notwithstanding
her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive
to guidance and is sensitive to, and responsive to the needs of her subordinates,

‘Imher performance of specific duty No. 2, she has brought to bear upon her
daily duties her broad experience, high jiitelligence- and good. operational sense,
functioning with practically no need of close supervision. It is comforting to
know that an assignment given to this employee is always done promptly, pro-

papers for the Branch because of her innate talents and
established reliability. She never failed to impress her super-
visor with her production, writing ability and energy. Her. overall
performance is clearly in excess of her grade level,

In terms of true cost and security-consciousness, she must also
be considered very strong because she has a positive and aggressive
attitude towards these subjects. It is with deep regret that the
Branch parts with this employee who now moves up to the Division
front office staff.

those of my predecessors, on this fine officer, I find myself hard put
not to repeat what has been said so often before. She has been the back~
bone of ‘this section and, of those where she has worked previously. Her
work has always shown exce!lent judgement and ingenuity. A self-starter
with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produced
has beeh prodigious. ._An_excellent team worker, she has never shirked whep-
as so often happens < she is asked to take on additional work or work ca
a matter outside of her regular field. While forceful, she is diplomati
and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a plea-
sant manner. She is one of the most dedicated persons I have met in the
Organization, and exceptionally dependable. While, as a:woman and a
Specialist, she has had little opportunity to handle agents she has done
very well with those we have given her to handle. She has showed great
ability in the training. of two transcribers and in the debriefing of two |
femalé agents and their husbands. This is in large part due to her in~  }_

---depth -knowledge of- the targets this section iS working om. The past few
months have, been difficult, requiring the complete reorganization of this
Section and the termination of the majority of our assets. - Under this
stress, she has performed in her usual outstanding amanner. Perhaps,
even a little better. Her handling of a great deal ‘of file work has been
excellent, probably in part because she was the one who set it up and has’

maintained it in its present very good state’. (continued)

The one criticism of this Officer's work that I and others
have made in the past still stands. She tries to do everything
and somethings in this business just don't deserve the attention
she gives then. :

I have no personal knowledge of her supervisor abilities,
but believe she is a natural leader.

She is the most thorough and, fastest working IA I have met. Her
capacity for hard work and long hours is prodigious. Her knowledge

of operational matters is equal to that of most case officers. She
has an operationally creative mind and has-made.many excellent
suggestions for the improvement of the section's work. Additionally,
her command of the Spanish language onhances all of the above abilities
This officer has found hor very pleasant to work with. She has a
unique ability to make constructive criticism in a tactful manner.

If this Subject has a weakness, it was pointed out by the reviewing
officer in the last fitness report when he said, "in her voracious
appetite for nll kinds of facts (she) can at timos put undue emphasis
on them, including factual minutiae as againet equally important but
more elusive subjective factors. - . - 4

Because of hor outstanding performanco and abilities the Subject
wilI bo given somo activity handling agent porsonnel, during the

The Subject's continued fine performance sinco her last promotion

Subject 1s extraordinarily rapid and efficient in researching for

Other real pros in the IA field. However, in addition, Subject has a
Good, tough, operations-ortented mind and positively contributes ideas:

used profitably. Subjoct has natural managerial abilities as recontly
demonstrated in her organizing TDY help in a station-wide file and

is more than adequate for reading reports, and handling operational
messages in that language. In sum, Subject is a tremendous station
asset and would be extremely hard to replace without noting a serious
loss in station officiency. : :

COMMENT? OF ABVIGaING QFOICIAL

. Although in my opinion there is an excessive use of “‘outstanding"
by the vating officer, Iam in accord with his narrative comments,
Subject is definitely more than an IA and has performed as such when
the station has required an individual with in-depth knowledgo of
station procedures, operational awareness combined with an ability to
prepare studies in a short period of time. She's thorough, concise .
and rapid. One of our hardest workers and most dependable employoes.

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS ” -continued

Three rather personalized comments might add meaning
to this fitness report. Anyone, particularly a female,
fitting the above description of efficiency and achievement _
can be, and often is a little overbearing and difficult to
work with as a person. Subject, withall, is a pleasant
Personality who knows how to make her contributions and
Comments in a forthright but tactful manner. Secondly, and
this one is a littlo hard to say, Subject in her voracious
appetite for all kinds of facts can at times put undue
emphasis on them including factual minutiae as against
equally important but more olugive subjective factors.
Thirdly, this rating officer has personally observed Subject -
only working on station premises at an office job, and
frankly has no idoa how she might function in outside , |
cent work (cultivating poople, working under outside “~~~

In July 1969 Subject was transferred from fhe Guba Settiba to the
Station front office to serve a3 an executive assistant to the COS with
special, responsibility for ensuring that the paper flow of the Station
remained-under effective control during the period of transition re-
sulting from the assignment here of several senior officers. This
transition period necessitated or gave rise to a number of changes in
the management and adninistrative areas of the Station. Subject's
performance in. this assignaent under these circumstances was clearly,
ontstanding. Her sound judgement, imagination and sesponsiveness to
guidance not only contributed to maintaining the stability and momentun
of the Station but also made possible an early effort to come to grips
with many of the problems which an inflated Registry and a highly dis-
tinctive records system created for the new Station amanagement tean.

.During the. ensuing six month poriod, Subject has recommended and
implemonted a nuaber of changes which have prodiced a more affective
and less costly records system.
stantially, input has benn vediced and now conforms to basic CS pro-
cedures and requirements. Personnel savings have been effected and
supervisory responsibilities more clearly delineated.

To sum up, Subject has mado and continues to “wake a major contribu-

tion Ln a singularly unsensational aiea of Station activity. Her atvic

Subject is aware that ber current assignment is an unusual one and
that she soon may have worked herself out of her current job. Since
she speaks fluent Spanish, ha3 a unique ability to get along with

her back into a position more closely supporting operations. Our

Subject's performance during the period of over one year under
review continued to deserve the rating of Outstanding. lier major
contributions during. that period were in the field’ of operational
research and exploitation of information obtained through technical
means, She was, during this period, given full responsibility for
the handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis=-
trative matters. In view of the difficulty of recruiting target
personnel the task of fully exploiting information obtained from
technical sources is of great importance. Subject handled this task
with her usual enormous capability for work, displaying initiative
and great professionalism. She continued, in addition, to handle the
other tasks listed in this report together with sensative reporting
sent by a separate channel, altogether a much heavior workload than
is usually carried by one person. She was helped in this by her
good knowledge of Spanish, a talent for administrative work, con-
siderable analytic experience and great devotion to her work.
Subject should be considered for promotion to the grade of GS-14 at
the first opportune moment.

her have come to expect of her. She continues to put forth her
best efforts at all times. . She is particularly to be commended
for the manner in .which.she cheerfully accepts oncrous tasks,

efficient, she is fully knowledgeable and capable in her job, she
has a friendly, warm, and pleasant personality, and is always
