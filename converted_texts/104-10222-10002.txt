MEMORANDUM FOR: Offico of Troining Registrar

THROUGH t TO/ORD
SUBJECT : Evnluation of Contract Management Institute
: Course

1. I attended the Contract Management Institute on 28 to
31 March 1967. Immediately after that course I submitted ex-

‘tenaive comments to Mr, Arthur Leach, DD/S&T cnordinator for the

course, and YI understand that those comments were included in
the overall recoumendations for future changes.

2. Since three snd ono~half months have transpired since
conpletion of that course, details such as the names of speakers
und subject material are a bit havy but I will repeat my overall
reontion to it for whatever benefit it might afford. The course

material was good although it eould ‘have been oriented much more i
Soxers ||

toward ‘tecinical project managers rathér than administrativ
officers, to the ultimate bene?zit of DD/SkT. Two of the speakers
wore excellent; howsver, the third, whe Blo waa apparently i
Director of the Institute was very poor both with respect to hig }
understanding of tho material snd his presentation. Dr, Xennedy

of Notre Dame and the lawyer, whose name I do not racull, vere

excolient.

3. This waa primarily a asles piteh for CPIF contracts.
My personal impresnuien was that U.S. Government contracting agea-
cies hava just about completed the circle of 2 great procurement
finaaco, fn departing from fixed~prica and CPFF centracts to CPIP’s
with various avard arrangements, the ¢ontract negotiatarna vers
unable.to really aver define ccst and ended up invariably in
giving away additional yoes to the ceatractors for nothing received.
Definitive costs were alwaya a function of experienced and sound

Course

technical investigation and management of a contrect and whea-
ever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates becane
almost completely unpredictable. ‘NASA and the DoD generally have,
therefore, gone from CPI¥y types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAY
type ends up being simply another CPFF but.with the contractor
having the advantage in the establishment of an award fee and
with the Governnent having no recourse to redetermination. My
reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms ny
own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for

a 'woll-managed CPFF-type arrangement.

effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro+

Further, during the past year giant strides have buen taken in the coordination ,
of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers, Thiy coordination has
been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the
forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction, On occasion
his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration
in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order, However,
his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in

_ truly large steps forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness cannot

Mr, Christ has been under my dircct supervision for about eighteen months,

during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and
Development, During most of the past year Mr, Christ has doubled as group leader
of the Radio-Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of
a separate Audio-Physics group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of
the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office. Mr, Christ has performed
these duties in a mangerial capacity in an extremely effective manner, so that both
groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining

basis.

Mr, Christ is extremely conscientious, receptive, and alert to the needs of
the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his
direction and supervision, His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout

indicate bt

the year, und 1s best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed

» Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during

a difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and
Development, During the process of reorganization of thésOffice, Mr, Christ hag
emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio~Physics and Audio«Physics arcas
of effort, which comprise about 40% of the effort in the Physical Sciences portion of
the Office, . ,
. Considéring his geographical location for the previous three years, Mr, Christ.
has done a remarkable job in organizing the Radio-Physics effort and in developing a
new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the
Office, All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in
the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and
organization of new ‘projects with an extremely under-manned staff,

Mr, Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive
in the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear”
Jability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new

objectives, In the development of the organizations necessary to implement these
programs, Mr, Christ has demonstrated a high degree of cost consciousness by.
organizing pergonnel of the two groups so that with a limited staff they could operate
in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contrace
tors to implement the program and to seek advice as to appropriate sources for such

yvocurement,

By BHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING weninesseay
Mr, Christ's outstanding weaknass reeults from his limited formal technical training
which in several cases is not as extensive as is the training of men that-he is
aupervising. He has off-set this short-coming to same extent by experience, good ~

increasing responsibilitica and has expertly implemented and fulfilled
the objectives for which his Division was formed in the carly growth
