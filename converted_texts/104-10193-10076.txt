BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL,

COMMENTS OF REVIECNG OFFICIAL
I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4.
I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than ''strong, "
‘with justification, I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall
-adminiatration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more
appropriately be rated "proficient, ' or perhaps "strong."

intelliyence and the handling of special opetations directed at Cuba,
Ke was obliged to work within a corplicated bureaucratic framework, a
fact which nade the’ “clearing of actions a laborious’ and time-consuming

ér. Harvey devoted éonsiderable ingenuity, long hours of personal
time, and great energy to this enterprise, aid, although certain

aspects of the intra-goverrmental coordination of the operations had

rough sledding, his net achievement was the establishment of an ef-
fective, going concern with momentum which carries on to the present.
