as part of our effort to consolidate basic Support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP
Section of activities. which do not contribute directly to the
pursuit.of priority recruitment targets, However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the

“REFERENCE: HMMW-15952, 27 November 1967

1. Headquarters' confusion regarding the various LIEMPTY
Properties is understandable, although each change in location
was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project
renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has
pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved, The con-
fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations in 1966
without changing cryptonyms, Up to this point, LIMITED had been
dn a building owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE frenting fer WOFIRY).
LILYRIC had been renting an‘apartment in a building in which
WOFITRM had no financial interest. In 1265, however, LINOUSINE
“bought thé property cov ning the building in whieh LIMITED had
been located, raced tiie building, and built a new building. in
which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however,
was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial
payment on the loan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that
he could buy the building), For various operational reasons it
was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building,
instead of the LIMITED crew, LIMITED was therefore moved into the

- building which LILYRIC had occupied, At, this point, of course,
new cryptonyms Should probably have been: assigned in order to

~ avoid the. confusion which has evidently develcped, (‘This vas not,

however, simply a switch of personnel ~ each base house retained...

its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were

nol changed). As tar as LICALLA is concerned, the confusicn

DISPAICH

Probably stems from the-tact that, while sts Lacation ne not
ehanged, it is Located within the "Linus buildin, which’ is-
owned by BOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE acting as :t") and which is
Adninistered. within the LIMLSA project. As slated, however, all
of this’ has been carefully documented for Headquarters Sef “The 7
LIMOUSINE purchase of thé old LIMITED building senerated iconsid=
erable correspondence (see particularly SHALL 21d4 and bit T7745
of January 1965), IU MAA2 8322 and HMMAj20O4d03 Bpelled out: the”
reasons tor switching LILYRIC and LIMITED, and the completion

of the move was reported in HMMA\~30687, Finally, sketches and
plans of the LILYRIC and LIMITED touges in their new locations

as LICALLA is concerned, its location and status was never open
to question, and its location in the LI“UST complex is Fegularly -

stands that’ a memo describing the locations of the various base
houses was attached to the most recent LIWESA project renewal
request wheo it was submitted to the staits by WH/1. I:

2, Personnel withia the base houses js also well-décumented
(most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent
ad the personnel have aever Leon switched from
house to house, Perhaps the best rundown of these personnel is
Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with HMMA~31164,

24 January 1967, . . :
It

“Station Real Property reports are also, with one
exception (MEXI-=41), up-to+date and they reflect current ' condi~
tions. MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA, Nevertheless,
the Station asked for $1800 for rent: and utilities for the
following reasons: first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable
expense no matter who owns the apartment. Secondly, the’ rent,
even though returned to the Station because iWOFIRM owns) the
building, must. physically be paid by the occupant of LICALLA,

He, in turn, is reimbursed by the Station via GERENDE, | LIMOUSINE
eventually returns the money, at which tine it is credited to
expense, This-could, of course, be handled differently! but the
Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner,
largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a! semi-

menths after the payment.

. 4, The Station neglected to cancel MZXI-41, which) should
be done as it refers to LILYNIC in its old location, before the
move in 1966, LILYRIC is now MEXI-132, and is in the building
owned by LIMOUSINE, Rent payments are, as originally latended;
being used to ‘help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as Snatructed
in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, the Station is erediting this money
to miscellaneous receipts, There can be, therefore, no’ question

of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in
ce the

which amounts to $2,880 per year ($3, 200 has been requested dn
order to include utilities), Headquarters is correct in) statiog

was 2,300 pesos per month. Statior files indicate that, the
reason for the increase (and this apparently was not reported
was that the bank which holds the na jor. Part
of LIMOUSINE's loan. had determined that 3 ,909 pesos was a fair
price for the apartment, The Station had, of course, no, choice
but to go along with this, . ; it

5. The Station has no record of MEXI-92, but it ie likely
that this is the old LIMITED apartment, which was indeed
purchased by WOFIRM (via LIMOUSINE) in 1955 But since that

IMOUSINE, the old
LIXITED apartment ceased to exist. The LIMITED base house was
subsequently transferred to the building which had previously
housed LILYRIC but not to the same apartmenb, and LIMITED is

At is evident that the Li ject reneval, whi used to
say 'LIMITKD and LICALLA rents are returned to Station by
LIMOUSINN and credited to Station miscellaneous receipts" should
how carry the footnote "LICALLA rent is returned to the Station
and credited to-exvense; LILYNIC rent is, and will be through
September 1969, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINE and credited
ton scellaneous receipts as partial raynent on Statioa loan to

6. Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom ia the room where the
films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC,. LINITED, and LIENTRAP are

| ‘]: |. headquarters - people who are unfamiliar with station —__

: . history - means ‘that we must turn to you with questions

H oftener than you might wish, Our present question
concerns property involved in LIEMPTY, (We are submitting
the.project as. received from the field, but do not ~

“understand the. ‘background very well. )

Le 2, HMMA-11257 of 16 January 1959," a project renewal, said-
that "approximately one year ago the LICALLA base was 2
purchased ‘by KUBARK through:. LIMOUSINE", and we ‘have not found
any. cables or dispatches which would show a change in that
status. Does MEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Beal Property Report
of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If go, ‘and if we own
LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and
‘utilities? | (Up until the subaission dated 1963 the project
renewal used to say “LIMITED and BICALLA rents are returned.
to station by LIMOUSINE and credited to station miscellaneous
receipts" but after that time this sentence was eliuinated.)

3. LIMITED is a different vrobtem complicate? by

‘the fact.that we are no-longer sure what the name refers -"
to. Originally we bought LIMITED and then sold it in
January 1965 to LIMOUSINE who put up a new building on
the lot..and,saved an apartment for our use, LIMOUSINE

now owns: the’ new: building, ‘but"MEXT 02, LIMITED Safchouse"™
js shown on the Real Property Report as "purchased" by :
WOFIRM in 1955 - should this not be corrected? A further
| complication is that ‘HMMA -31164, GERENDE's January 1967

’\ gecurity review, speaks of LILYRIC in its present new
‘.:Jocation, Inhabited by LIEMPTY/13, /14 and /27, Has the

old LIMITED been re-christened LILYRIC because of its new -
‘4{nhabitants?.. When was it completed and are we still
“withholding rent from LIMOUSINE in settlement of his
payment -to us forthe property. The REAL Property Report shows
LILYRIC, MBXI- 41, a5 having been leased in 1958 and
costing $1030. to maintain ($856 rent, $44 reparis, and $130.
utilities). “It also shows MEXI 132 LIMEPTY, LIMOUSINE, LILYRIC
as having been rented in October 1966 for $2880 a yearg~
~.@hich is more than the 2,300"Monthiy rent for the flst

in his new building which LINCUSINE agrced that we would
withhold for a period of two years after completion in.
partial settlement of his purchase of the LIMITED property.)
(AMMA 25310, 3 February 1965.) . :

4. Waat does the LIEMPTY darkrcom consist of?

Qo 5. We are, as you can see, confused, Would you be
kind enough to send us a brief summary of each of the four
