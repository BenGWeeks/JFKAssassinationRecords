‘We are denonstrating to the world that Cuba,..is 4

hém, but after their arrival on ;
iy: abe rtiés settled down to a detailed
meeting tn pritiary tion was given to administrative
matters, trade and propaganda. The lattez two subjects will
be dealt with in separate dispatches, On the administrative
side, RUIZ listened synpathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings and inadequate operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
‘expenses and a-report.on the.consuls’ current needs, their
monthly. balances-and their administrative activities, The
printing and telephone bills wero the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions,

. 4, By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
‘on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in, general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed with his subordinates, He started by assuring
-them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and Hector GALLO Portieles, who had previously been
most “eager to return PCS to Havana, now has gone to Havana
on vacation, He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia

flight.

5, The Cuban mission has certain financial problems
since the present budget. dates from previous yee"s and does
not cover current expenses. However, the “new economic
activities of the consulate” are expected to assist with the
problem. Here RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
brought to bear in November. 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigration. Office to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
passport. Enough exiles have responced to this pressure to
relieve gome of the financial problems of the Cuban mission,
This source of income will last:as long as the Cubans’ friends
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist then, °

continuing adrinistrative problem for the Embassy, Jose
DIAZ Puga, who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusivaly to taking care of the courters
and their pouches when any come in, leaving visitors to fend
for themselves, This situation. has been alleviated by
other Embassy staff menbers jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared

- that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because

they have a work plan to fulfill, Thus, he has left himself

reduced to a very narrow circle and since Cuba was) "in"
economically it was now necessary to give attention to
the political and cultural fields. He-later commented
on the. fact. that- Cuba is practically unknown in Spain,
iat Cuban products ave never seen in the local -storeg
and that ‘the view \of Cuba of the average Spaniard has’
©. come frem ‘the exiles. He has .continued=to discuss the
need for advertising Cuban Products and considered
“) decerating his office and Nis home: with ‘Cuban items and
furnitire so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his
. Spanish. and foreign contacts, Another consequence of
this'desire to put Cuba's best foot forward is a certain
harshness in dealing: with the shortcomings of his - a
‘colleagucs and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling
“attention to any deficiencies in thetr conduct and ways
of. dealing with’ the persons they meet. As recently .ag
‘dna’ QUDOZE port of 13 July he was complaining that the
have lost -the elegant touch in their |

Cubans sceén..
public functions,

. . 3.-.RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically
“|... from his desire, that: Cuba's prestige increase and he is
quite willing: to spend money where it will show. The~
Embassy's 6 Jantary. reception was’ an’ expensive affair,
the Embassy -and ‘Commercial officers take their Spanish
contacts to the best restaurants, he and his wife pay
30,000 pesetas (approximately $ 430.00) rent per month
for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new
clothes without ‘hesitation for tie various diplomatic
functions, © Before- he. went on home Yeave on 6 August 1968,
he, was encouraging his stafr to rent better apartments
that would more nearly match their status as diplomats
and his wife was looking for a different house for then,
one with fewer maintenance headaches and with rooms large uy
~ > enough for afiall receptions of as many as 40 people, yy
fay vf. this is quite in accord with RUIZ's own bourgdisa
Jf tastés, reflected more than any thing eIsé in his grea
Interest in clothes and in. being well dressed. Yet the
Cuban mission Operates on a slim budget and the salaries
are not high. Station Madrid has no information on
whether Cuban mission Personnel receive a housing
allowance but assumes they must as otherwise RUIZ, at
least, could never make ends meet. RUIZ earns a gross
‘ salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses
including clothes, food, medical expenses, education for
the couple's 5 children and perhaps utilities must come
_from this sum. RUIZ also expects to be able’to invite
Cuban officiils transiting Madvid and his Spanish and
foreign contacts home for Lunch or dinner at any time.
There is no indication that he receives a representation
allowance yet he will allow his wife to charge nothing
except the Salaries of two maids to the Embassy and she
can't economize on food when they are alone because he
will go out to a restaurant rather than eat rice and “beans.
RUIZ is. plainly ‘cautious in his dealings with Havana over
money, even while wanting to live as well as possible
in Madrid. The difference in the couple's manner of
living between flavana and Madrid must be striking since
RUIZ had ‘a good position in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce
prior to becoming Charge d'affaires and yet his wife told
Vera, the Embassy secretary and her closest triend, that
she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would like
to take one back with her if they did not return to Madrid
after home leave! . :

4, As an {ndividual, RUIZ has appeared in .
QUDOZE/QUTISHD as nervous, sapricious, quick tempered. ©.
In contrast ‘to his"plcasant™ public appearance and his

- usually acceptable telephone language. his private
conversation is vulgar,’ low and full of ugly words.
We swears” Con tititially “and” flies off into. rages. He is
. a Compulsive talker and apparently uses his long.
“conversations:.and his cosultations over some course
of action as a means of psychological reinforcement.
‘He has given’ the impression of being insecure in his
-Rosition and when faced with an accumulation or
problems in the ‘office prior to home leave, was talking
of resigning and returning to Cuba. This insecurity
may account: for ‘his touchiness over the way he is...
treated by ‘the Spaniards, éspecially those in government
positions~ “He has been noted describing several of -his
int ews :with. Spantsh Ministers or People holding
nt government positions at great length, going”
ito ‘much detail on the length of the meeting, if they
‘shook hands, if the person smiled, if he Nad anything
nice to sdy about Cuba or ‘the Cubans, ete. As the
. addressees know, “RUIZ came to his post as a. transfer
. + from thé Ministry of Foreign Commerce. On numerous
' /°* o€casions he has said that his life interest is in
commerce and industry and prior. to his vacation ‘in Cuba,
he was increasingly depressed over his present position
and his ability to fill it, which may account for some
of this sense of personal uncertainty. He has seemed
a hard worker and a man with good ideas on the work of
the Embassy and how it should be organized, ideas which
he has repeated endlessly, but he has been unable to” |
inspire in his subordinates. In his disputes with GALLO
in June he complained about the lack of team spirit in
: et

the office.

§. -RUIZ's political ideas are centered in the Cuban

revolution and the Station considers him as an

ff unquestioned regime supporter. However, his approach
is di en rom that of the younger, less. intelligent
ymen who have known nothing else. RUIZ has hada.
'; sufficient breadth of education and experience to make
fa choice, to have reached his own decision that the
'' Castro regime is good for Cuba and that Marxism as
interpreted by the Cubans is an adequate intellectual
foundation for life. A QUDOZE Report of 13 December 1967
included a discussion with a Spanish employee of thé
Embassy during which RUIZ explained that the Cuban
revolution is different from any other revolution there
has ever-been in the world, that it has different

“a mark of Marxist principles it has many. variations :
which make it different. These variations are unknown
even to some of the comrades themselves. In a QUDOZE
Report: of 23 June, he commented on certain features of
the Cuban system as “very difficult to understand unless
one is of the left", The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted
extensively in OSMA~24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed
most clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as
one entity and to sce himself within that structure, a
part of it and serving it. Beyond that, his mind runs
in business and public relations -rather than political

Referénce: OSMA-24,050 dated 12 July 1968

Action Required: FYI

1. At. the time the referenced dispatch was prepared, - —
. the QUDOZE Reports were: showing the beginning of a full
fledged fight between Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the Charge
d'affaires of the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and his first
Secretary,: Hector GALLO Portieles, As soe often happens in
human relations, less important issues proved the vehicle
for expressing deeper conflicts and problems, In this
case, the primary problem can be simply summarized. The
members of RUIZ'’s staff operate independently of their
chief and he feels he is neither consulted nor informed by
his subordinates on their activities, This is particularly
true in relation to GALLO, The specific issues which
sparked their quarrels were RUIZ'’s dispute with Emilio
ROMERO, editor of the newspaper Picblo, and the distribution
-of Che GUEVARA's Diary. . : :

2. A QUDOZE Report of 2 July 1968 outlined a hot
discussion that ensued when RUIZ went into a rage over a
phone call GALLO had received from Emilio ROMERO, RUIZ
and ROMERO are not on speaking terms whereas GALLO and
ROMERO get along well. GALLO said he -feared enmity with
ROMERO would bring about the. publication of articles
unfavorable to Cuba whereas RUIZ replied that when the first -
unfavorable article comes out, he will:itake it to the
Foreign Minister and settle the matter on that level. He
believes that he represents Cuba in Spain and that his

subordinates should back him by taking the same positions
in public that he takes, a not unreasonable demand on
the part of a Chief of Mission, RUIZ bluntly told GALLO
that he, GALLO, had committed an crror.and GALLO just as
bluntly. disagreed, - GALLO's view was that RUIZ had come in
im a bad humor and nothing pleased him whereas RUIZ felt
GALLO. should try putting himself in RUIZ's place, something
he- claims GALLO is incapable of doing. Finally, this
particular argument ended in a form of compromise with

_--, GALLO agreeing to call ROMERO the following day and remind

oi him’ that. he "should call the Minister",

3. On 4 July: the battle was renewed over the
distribution of Che's Diary, At that time the Embassy
only had 6 or 7 copies. which were being loaned out on an
overnight basis, RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary
"to a mountain of people" while GALLO was also offering
-it freely and without consulting RUIZ about. the action or
his list of recipients, RUIZ scolded him roundly for this.
and,. ignoring GALLO's attempts at self-justification, told
him he had to respect the instructions he received, At
one point in his tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to
suggest it would be better for one of them to leave and go
to work in another country, for example Rumania. Several
interesting items emerged from this long quarrel: .

3 related’ ‘to his pers lity and his:
Ruiz said,

of the problem. .« Ruiz then: insisted ‘on the
importance of discussing problems among the comrades
and said "for example in your case, you have been
foolish in not. outlining the problem, I was waiting
and ESPINO was waiting and PILOTO".

: B, RUIZ commented that now he can understand

the attitude of CALZADILLA, Before, he had thought
CALZADILLA was in error but’ now he feels the same way.
He. mentions "an, ambivalence" and says he will not
“that CALZADILLA was: wrong. an -.

just a few." ”

Se rey "-RUIZ-takes.a- broader view..of. Party. membership -
than this contemporaries.’ In commenting on the weekly

- study circle for members. of the Party, he set forth
his opinion that all the comrades of the local Cuban
Mission should participate even though they may not
be members because in his eyes it is as if they all
really were members,

D, RUIZ repeated a statement he has made on

previous occasions - the great interest of his life
is foreign commerce, However, in this 4 July QUDOZE
Report, he added the interest ing detail that he had’
not wanted to come to Madrid as Charge and, in affect,
had been persuaded to come against his will, He

. believes he is best able to serve in the control of

. ‘ industry and that is where he could perform a

tremendous work for his country as every revolutionary

to do the most, "Until now, £ have always done )

with my present limitation of criteria, I should I

because. I arrive at. my conclusions through the
accounting...look, here I am wasting my présence
and my resources when I am able to be useful to
- Production in another position,”

By the-end-of this 4 July report, RUIZ had exhausted all
his combativeness and appeared very. depressed,

24. RUIZ-is due for home leave in Havana the first
part of August; There have been indications scattered
‘throughout the QUDOZE and QUTIMID Reports of the last
month or two that he might: not return, The information

"2. -On.10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, in one of his-many: daily”
discussions with his subordinates, reflected oh the international -
position of his country.,.and among the things he ‘said, we quote.
thé following which ma (of possible interést to addressees, *
. Although part of the discussion was’ not heard because of the”
 eriotional inflection of. the’ speaker, we feel that the jist of
the: discussion is clear and understandable. 5 i .

“We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...is
favorably disposed to’ do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins

to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise. the white flag.;.becausé the -
first plane that appears on radar... (AMAUTO-1 ‘is
speaking excitedly and itis very difficult to understand
each word but it appears that he is talking about the
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camaguey and:that with these missiles, we can cover.
Miami, New York, and all their bases and all of their
"mierda", , .if the Americans say they are going to
sad them (missiles? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the
first plane that comes to invade...(AMAUTO-1's sub-
ordinate remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point .
in international politics, when the Yankees ordered -\”
the. Soviets to withdraw their missiles). . .(AMAUTO~1
injectéd) ."they (the Soviets) presented them (the |
Cubans) with ten bombs", . er

2. Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive mnis—

. JAN 30 1963 1. “When Guillermo RUIZ Perei,,. ‘the new ‘Cuban Charge met
B3c. angi,With the Cuban consuls, following his arrival in Spain, the
“Pesttt. was a long meeting at which primary attention was -

given to administrative matters, trade and propaganda, The
subject. 6f: propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch.

2. ._ The:Castro regime has always attached great
importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the
new Cuvan Charge d'Affaires began to re-organize the work of
his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked.
According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations, the .
provincial consulates have been receiving four types of
propaganda for distribution, two of which were identified,
One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created .
by the Castro regime, for example "The Voice of Vietnam",
.The other if newspapers, PACHECO, Consul in Seviila,
mentioned Granma, which he claimed many people read, and
added that idately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde.

3. “RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and
the distribution of propaganda, He asked the consuls to
make a list of all the institutes and all the scientific
centers in their territories including the special positions
of these centers and any other relevant information, They
are to use these lists to develop a systematic work plan
of visiting each one, making friends, trying to obtain
scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and
propaganda of every type, free if possible or by subscription

.if necessary, The consuls were told to go with the attitude —
of “looting”. . 7°). , .

. 4, Even while he was laying these responsibilities
on. his consuls, RUIZ was busy within the Embassy. in
discussions with. Andres MARTINEZ, “a Spanisi cmpivyce who
. works on cultural matters,and is responsible for publication
- of the Embassy bulletin, RUIZ mentioned that he is 1
- interested in offering Cuban documentaries to Spanish Cine
- (Movie) Clubs as! they now have.a large number, "an infinity",
of documentaries Showing both Cuban technical application -
' ..and how the people live, RUIZ also:asked to see copies of
the Embassy bulletin-and-in the, meantime suggested MARTINEZ
“doa bullétin-drawing a. parallel between Gibralter and
-Guantanamo, Finally, according to a QUDOZE. report of
-11 December 1967, Hector GALLO Portieles had ‘been ordered
’. | to prepare-a work plan: for cultural activity. In this
context cultural ‘activity is not limited to-art;-music and
.-. Literature but. also includes public information media, The :
Cui mbassy ‘has already built up a series of press contacts
over the past years and the Cuban Revolution seems to draw
‘a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as
evidenced by the Spanish delegates attending the Cultural
Congress held in’ Havana from 4-11 January 1968, An expense-
paid trip is always attractive to be sure but the delegates,
many. of whom were not communists, were also, sympathetic to
the host, Accordingly, within the limits imposed by the
“Spanish government, Station Madrid expects an increase in
the propaganda and‘ political action activities, of_the Cuban
official establishment, sys

Plans of New Cuban “A assador in Mady id”

ACTION REQUIRED - “af

1, . The new. Cuban Ambassador to Spain, Orestes
Guillermo RUIZ; ‘Perez arrived in Madrid on'the Iberia flight
of 3 December’. 1967 accompanied by. his wife, Nilda, and three
sons, ‘CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor Had not .been a strong
administrator. and -had let the various components of the -.
“Cuban, official establishment in Spain run their own affairs,
This fact plus the inevitable ‘tendency of a new chief to be
a "new broom" and rearrange things according.to his own
lights, led Station Madrid to expect some ‘changes particularly
within the Embassy. However, the QUDOZE ‘and QUTIMID operations
have shown RUIZ at least initially to be an aggressive and
well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly
reflect his background vin commercial affairs and prepared to
make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial
sweeping of a new broom, Underlying RUIZ's actions and
proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid
with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in
Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness, Station
Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant
information on this program as it becomes available from the
QUDOZE and QUTINID operations along with information on the
official Cuban personalities administering the program,

2.. A striking difference between RUIZ and his
predecessor was noted inthe QUDOZE and QUTINID reports of
that first week, RUIZ has no inhibitions over Spending
money, One of the Enbassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with:
a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other
two Peugeots with new ones, Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked
up by the wife of GOVIN who turned $200 over to her to go”

_ known department stores, RUIZ checked with GALLO, his _
deputy, en the proper clothes for diplomatic functions in.
Madrid and’ an appointment was to be made with a.tailor, ~
Nilda-declared that the apartment where CALZADELLA and his
family, had Lived-économically was inadequate and they ¢
decided to look for a chalci, something very spacious and x
well-priced, They subsequently seriously considered one
known to rent for 30,000 pesetas ($500) per month and then
‘turned it down, apparently for reasons other than price, A
new telex machine. was erdered for the Embassy. The technictan
stated. they. could install-.a-teletype that could only receive,
not send, messages but this seemed acceptable, .

: 3... On Monday; 4 December: 1967, the day.after his arrival,
UIZ ordered the Cuban ‘consuls in Barcelona, Sevilla and

go to Madrid fora meeting. The ‘order. was couched in terms
of "wanting to meet" them, but after their arrival on
Wednesday, 6 December, all parties settled down to a detailed
x ¢ tion was -given to administrative
matters; trade-and propaganda, ' The latter two subjects-will |
be dealt-with in scparate dispatches, On the administrative
side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to, complaints about low
salaries, old buildings and inadequat? operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a report on the consuls! cursent needs, their
_monthly balances and their administrative activities.. The
printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions.

4, By the end-of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mtssion
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first

~. discussed with his subordinates, He started by assuring
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was
complete, Apparently, RULZ intends to make no personnel
changes and: Hector GALLO Portieles, who had previously been

’ most eager to return PCS to Havana, now has gone to Havana

on vacation, He left ‘Madrid on the 20 December 1967_ Iberia

flight.
5. The Cuban mission has certain financial problems

since the present budget dates from previous years and does
‘not cover current expenses, However, the "new, economic .
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the

_ problem, Here RUIZ is’ presumably yeferring to the pressure
brought to bear in November 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in a
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigra:ion Office! to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.59 fee for a valid
passport, Tnough exiles have responded to this pressure to.
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission,
This source of .income will last as long as the Cubans' friends
in the Foreign. Ministry are able to assist them,

6, The reception of Cuban official travelers at the
airport and the handling of Embassy pouches poses a
continuing administrative problem for the Embassy, Jose
ga, who is in_charge of this ai work has to
deve himself exclusively to taking 7
_and their pouches when any cone in, leaving visitors to fe
for themselves, This situation has been alleviated by :

other Embassy staff:members jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared
that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because
they have a work planito fulfill. Thus, he has left himself
with an unresolved problem he must face in the very near

future,
