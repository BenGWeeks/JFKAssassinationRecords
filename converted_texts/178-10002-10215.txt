Q Do you know whether or not they consider him an

established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -~- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A L can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect,anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
they would have to coordinate with the Latin
american Division before they did anything since we do hoid
the file.

Q Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A A 201 file igs a personnel file. It consists of any
information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
9 Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

A This is what I was trying to think of.

Q -~ that would be considered covert action?

A well, as I say, a lot of propaganda, press placement, |
media placement. It has been so ‘long ago I really doen't

remember. I know we had a number of things going against him.

We used suasion, moral suasion, otherwise. We did some

extra-legal things. We tried to get to his sources of supply,

particularly when they were countries that we had treaties
with, NATO countries, Canada, this type of thing.

2 Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said

you used moral suasion. What kind of activities are you

referring to? _ : ; |
A. Well, in the moral suasion field we -- actually, we

{

were the catalyst in this whole thing and we had the legal

activities, the legal -- well, I don't know how you would

hrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control |
P * 1
i
i

regulations of the Treasury Department, the Trading with the

Enemy Act, and we also used the facilities of the Department of!

Commerce, the Export Control people.

; |
I. guess as you are aware, Cuban industry was totally |

U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

thing, Castro had his little people there running around trying

companies. Where
we would find this out through all-source intelligence, we

or the Treasury people or the Commerce people would go to the

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.
It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn'

want him to get the exchange, So it was those types of

activities.

Q Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or U.S.

companies enlisted in that effort?

A Oh, yes.

2 In what manner cid you use U.S. companies and
businessmen?

A Well, we simply used them as the experts. A great

many ~~ the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the
American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchange, this

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And. we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because i

Q And this particular Station, then, was under the
supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

Q When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume
responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the
Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western
Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

9 Is there presently a Miami Station?

Q And how large is it at the present time?

Cuban Operations, I don’t know how large it is at the present
time’ because we are in one of these periods: where’ we -are
reassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year
there*’are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time --- collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this
type of thing. Covert action.

number of other people. When she hit the -- they had a recep-
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there and
we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under Immigration
and) Naturalization Service cover. When the BEW people did the
preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill

out forms, where. were you born, this type of thing, bioagraphic+
type thing. These forms: would be passed to our-peopte who would
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, md they felt that perhaps they

might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them. /

A Well, the AiOTS were Cuban a Cuban intelligence
organization in exile. We full intended -- this was part of the

overall contingency pian that US Government had. Should Castro
ever be overthrown, these people would be the nucleus to go into
Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

0. Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism
for Security Agency?

A. Well, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and.

A. You mean in terms of vears?
a Yes.
A Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings as such, of course --
we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out
and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut off
about, I quess about 1970 or '71, in that timeframe ~~

0 I see. , ; :

A -- that stopped the flow of the refugees, so we just
terminated that part of the activity.

0. ‘Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

|
in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions --

A No.
0, In the community? ~
A Well, I can't give you a real ves or no‘to that. I

would suppose: that: there is'an' outside possibility: they could
have been used to debrief people within the community, within
the Cuban community, but we had'in the organization -- all these
people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an
On-Site Case Officer, who was'a fulltime: staff-emplovee and he
had a couple of assistants, including a secretarv. These people
were directly under his control. Though the organization as it
was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

become nationalized out in California and your record of

nationalization wouldn't be reflected here in Washington for

two years. That is how far thev are behind.

0. I take it, then, that there is a possibility that the

course, we had targets for recruitment. It could range from
anything from a first mate, a captain or chief engineer of a
Cuban maritime vessel to Fidel. When we targeted these people

that all the information on that individual be assembled so that

service of Cuba?

A. Right.

A Well, oriqinally they were set up to assist with the |

“AS we phased down the maritime activities, they were made
available to intercept Cuban communications, NSA‘ tasks’ them with
thefrequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications
nets: they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another
important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,
sugar, transportation, maritime. I think there was an interior
network they covered too, But all electronic intercept coverage

is. dictated by NSA.

a two-way street. It wasn't simply that we assisted these

2 What assistance would you render for members of
the press in Miami?

A Well, in the case of the Latin American editor
we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of
areas he periodically visited and the Chiefs of Stations
would give him background briefings and this type of thing
on che developments within a given country.

Q Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?

A Predominantly, I would say prebably the Miami
received probably a little more attention than.the
other papers, principally becauseyit was 2 large paper and

their Latin American editor traveled a great deal throughout

the Hemisphere.

2 Was he also used as a source?
