SUBJECT: - Operational Plen for Continu! Lng
on Operet tons Against Cubs

3, Action: This memorandua is for your inforastion

‘gnd pursuant to your request, Recommendations for action rrea

contained ia Parugraph V below. The purpose of this memercnn ss:

‘ia to dcolineste an operational pina for the action which we
" believe should be taken by CIA ogainst Cuban fur the predictahls

future, In‘ guamary the plan provides for ccntinuing, even
intensifying, the intelligence effort egeinst Cubs and for
the reorientation of the current effort into » long tern

denied area type of operation of the highest priority.

I, ASSUMPTIONS:
‘A. The United States Governnent will give public
assurances that, provided no nuclerr or offeusive weapers = 2r

present or re-introduced into Cuba, end provided Cubs deer

not take Betdon to threaten the perce. -ond security of the |



--- Page 9 ---
14-0000

3 These assurances will preclude eny ‘meaningful CIA
action ‘on a phesed basis to provoke a revolt inside Cubz, sinve
unless there are major changes in operational and internal con-

- ; ditions: in Cuba, such a revolt if provoked would be totally

deatroyed Py Cuban Counteraction in Rg. } matter of hours or, ot

‘es a practical matter will, preclude invading Cuba on the pretext
‘of a contrived provocation such as en attack on Guantanamo.
2Ce CIA, operations: involving a. high noise level anda
* diatiaet ‘elenent of -attributability, particularly paramilitary,
" guerrilly,. ‘and conmande type operations will. be unacceptable
as a matter of ‘policy.
De The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for
‘the indefinite. future, with its security and control apparatus
relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing
, unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational
: conditions 1a Cuba increasingly difficult. While it. is
possible that recent and future developments including the
Soviet action in renoving the offensive weapons from Cube nury
serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no hard
indication that the control of the Castro-comnunist regime over
; Cae ahd toca rabetactiy weakenod, .

., The _Vaited States assurances of no invasion and no

- support of: an invesion will, in effect, constitute giving tc
Castro and his regime a certain degree of ssnctuary. This will

{ i’ severely denoge the aorale and motivation of anti-regine Cubene
| _ both inside sad. outside of Cuba, ‘which will make it ineressingiy
‘ : - dattiouit for us to. recruit agents, maintain agents already
recruited, and. continue or intensify our intelligence and other
efforts against Cuba and the Castro-communist regine.

objective ita the overthrow of the Castro-conmunist regime.
“This ig an unrealistic objective, however, except.on a very
.  long-tera, basis as tie. United States Government, we believe,
. jc ~ will be unwilling in the. immediate future to commit troops
' to support such, an overthrow. The United States Governnent
in ats overt dealings with the Cuben exiles probably will not
"express. ‘the above factors to them in the context or with the
bluntness: stated here,
, |G. In view of these factors, the so-called “Irzek Tro",
. course of action, 14.6., unlimited support of Cuban exiles
and exile ETOUpS. with no real control or objective purposes

in the hope that ‘these groups will be able to shake the

_ Castro regiae will, although unrealistic, become _increzs ing ty

attractive at various levels in the United Sts tes Government.

; q. As & matter of policy, political pressures end
"economic pressures short. of blocksde,. raids, sad | aggressive

sabotage against Gaba: will be continued.



--- Page 11 ---
14-0000

qT. Fi view of the above assumptions prramilitary, command

and sabotage. operations, except in rare selective instonces

will serve Little purpose; also they will be counter-procuct tye
since, it. ‘undertaken, they will make the collection of intelli.
gence more diftzionlt and should. only be undertrken in those very

' few instances. where an ubusually high return can be demonstreted,

Regardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for
tetion against Cuba, it would ?ppear clear that Higher Authartiy

. wu insist on os continued, . even intensified, tatelligence

coverage of Cuba.
J, ‘In view of the policy factors, an iacreased use of

facilities,’ veal estate sad basing outeide the United States,
'° particularly in’ Latin Auerics, will be both necessary snd
desirable. ,

Adequate aerial reconnaissance of Cuba will continue.

iz. “OBJECTIVES:

‘Based on the above sssumptions, the following objectiven
appear to be proper for continuing CIA operations against

‘Cuba 3

Set out below aro specifics of operational action it is
proposed to take to continue and, as possible, increase ine
telligence coverage of Cube.

1. fateliigence Exploitetion of Refugees: As you
know, with the quarantine and the cessntion of sir
braver t the heavy’ flow of Cuban refugees haa dwindled

o almost to nothing. In view of this and in connection

with the contingency pilenning for supporting any persibis
mjiitary sotion in Cube, the Opa-Locks Interrogation - .

Canter as auch was disaantied, : although. the personnel

‘of. the Center have been retained intact. In order to
- re-astablish. the flow of intelligence from refugees,
it is. proposed that. Pon Auerican Airvays and KLY be
" taducea to. ‘velnatitute their: regular: flights from

Havana to Mims.’ This should be done as scon a3

" possible after the settlement of the current nogotinttons

and UN discussions. Coincident with this, _the Opa~Locka
vefugee’ interrogation center will be re-established

, with the sane personnel.

- Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be

‘made to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the

viability of and, where necesssry, re-establish commmica-

' tieas: with the isi recruited agents now resident in Cube.
To an ‘extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort
_ will of course depend upon the stringency of future

Cuban security snd control action, which it is impossible

as yet to accurately forecast.

3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re-

cruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cubs

will be reiterated gnd strengthened and every effort

. is will be made to jucrease. this coverage, both through

“the Asvelopnent of additional resident agents in ‘Cuba

‘prinartly at continued intelligence collection and nt

‘other Catans, who already are ‘legally resident in Cubs

in the sress where. the tenns are operating (Pliner el
Rio and Oriente). In addition, on the most carefui ly

selected basis, where it appears feasible, additional

. agents. and teams will be. infiltrated black into Cuba

in an effort ‘to duplicate the performance of the cosra

8nd AMTORRID teans and particularly to. recruit and, ca
_ possible, train additional agents legally resident in
Cuba.

“LL. Exfiltration: As feasible, sgents and potentist
recruits wow in Cuba will be exfiltrated for

_- tyaining, indoctrination, supplying with communications,

and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated inte
Cube, primarily on intelligence missions. Where porsible,
this will be done through legal travel channels, but
where this is not possible, it will be done wherever

‘feasible through our black inf iltration~exfiltration
