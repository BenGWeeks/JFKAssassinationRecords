continued to maintain a satistactory degree of morale in agents assigned
him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and con-
tinued. to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of

a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally
by Subject on illegal ac vities ‘of Cuban ‘refugees was of great interest
to other agencies offic in the area, Suvject was the only Station

| source of such Laforma'tion which was acquired only because of Subject's
ability :cto maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period
because of .the cutback in infiltration operations, . .

It could also.be noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this
Station and prepares for his noxt assignment, that he is a thoroughly
professional intelligence officcr-and is, in many ways, an outstandircg
one. Technically,-he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though
his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as
well, Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and papport

Subject has shown a decided proficiency in the supervision of
the type of unit for which he has responsibility. Is men respect
him and follow his orders readily. He is resourceful, acts with
initiative, and delesater responsibility. In his field he thinks
clearly and is decisive and versatile in his actions, He is capable
of handling larger units of personne] and assuming greater responsi-
bility in the PM field. If be were required to accept dutics of a
broader nature tn tho intelligence field involving less supervision

-of his own activitics, he: would need to improve in the areas of
written and oral expresston ‘and in his understanding cf KUBARK
requirements and responsibilities, In this regard he would need
additional training and exposure to more extensive KUBARK fields

As a former military officer, Subject ‘is hard working and abundantly
sincere in his efforts to Light Communism. His Performance since Aux 1981
has not been at the top level of his capabilities fer several reasons,
not all of which are within his ability to overecene. Subject has had
little clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to compre-
hend the intangible factors which prevent, delay and cancel operations.

A further reason is the absence of military law as a basis for discipline
fe Mis men. Still another reason is the directive for only Limited

on with which he has had to live since August. This is merely to say
aut-in-a period of policy formation when the action forces have had to
be held in Limbo, he has not been at his best. .

Subject's-dealings-with his agents have in tura been affected by his
own frustrations. His inability to rationaltze situations has resulted
in obtuse explanations to them which have made: them harder to handle.
His reluctance to’ put things on paper has detracted.from his performance
and denicd him the clarifying process which reporting provides. His
security consciousness has been Similarly affected by his frustrations,
: Subject is in need of training in tradecraft acd PM operations. His
basic qualifications for PM Case Otficer work are such that he can,with
training, do a much better Job. This combined with a, Program of concen-
trated action would undoubtedly bring out the best in him, which should

be of real value to the Agency.

MEMOZANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJZCT ; Grayston L, Lynch

REF ZAZNCE: Mr. Lynch's memoranduin to
Director of Personnel, dated
22 June 1971. :
i. On the basis of what lL can recail from the time I was

connected with the Bay of Pigs activity and ray years with WH
Division therealter, Mr. Lynch has stated his tasks correctly,

2. Since the issue ia whether Mr, Lynch's service in Miami
could te erzeidered equivalent to that of an Operations Officer over-
seas, the following might be considered:

34ir. Lynch had to operate clandustinely,

He used pseudonyms, safesites for mectings, non-
official cover,

He handled, trained and dis patcned agents. He
debricicd them. He worked with thern aide by side,

He worked long, irregular hours (days and nights)
uncer unusual pressures and at persanally inconvenient
and unzppealing sites.

tir. Lynch was, during the Bay of Pigs period at
least, in real personal danger, (Our case officers abroad
do not often face such situations nor do they have to display
sucn courage.)



--- Page 43 ---
14-0000

3. In summary, Mr. Lynch's tasks were professionall
y y y
y those of many of our
sly clandestine techniques

and personally more demanding
Operations Officers abroad. “He had to
and concepts. in a highly volatile and difficult operational climate.
To admit-him to the CIA Retirement System seems justified.

MEMORANDUM.-FOR;: Director of Personne

Recommendation for X2proval of

SUBJECT :

Mr. Grayston L, L; asa Participant

in the CIA Retiremezi and Disability System
REFERENCE : HR 20-50

1, It is strongly recommended that Nx. Grayston L. Lynch
be approved aa a participant in the CLA Retirement and Disability

System,

2. It is the opinion of the Special Operations Division that
the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the time he entered on duty
in February 1961 until carly 1968 meet the t and intent of the
criteria for ‘qualifying service!! as detined HR 20-50b, The lone
exception to these criteria is that Mr, Lyn s not "abroad"
during the time involved except ona sporad is, This exception,
however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area
of operations, This location made it uniquely propitious to have
Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base. There is
no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's service was in the conduct
and support of covert operations which reg continuing practice
of security and tradecraft procedures and which included, from
time to time, hazards to his life and health. itis also believed
that Mr; Lynch would be at a disadvantage in taining other employe
ment because of the sensitivity of his past secvice as well as the
dearth of requirements for his peculiar background, skills and

knowledge,

3, On the basis of the above and Mr, Lynch's unique per-
sonal record, it is believed that his servic sing the described
period is certainly equivalent to if not in cxcess of the requirements
for "creditable service abroad! and that if it Rad not been fora
geographical accident, this service would have been performed as



--- Page 46 ---
part of an assignment abroad within the fullese meaning of the definis
tion contained in the referent regulation, Therefore, approval of
Mr, Lynch's request for designation as a participant in the CLARDS
on tho basis of service performed between 1961 and 1968 ip not only
strongly recorirnended but is requested as the grant of an entitlement
fully earned by a very deserving employee,

Mr. Lynch it is necesiary to terminate Mr. Lync
Agent. Since he is-cligible for Involuntary Retirement under CLARDS, Mr,
Lynen bas made application for retirement effect 10 September 1971,

In view of Mr, Lynch's age, specialized skills, long service ina uniquely

Mr. Lynch is currently the equivalent of 4 GS-14, step 5 with an

therefore, less than 42% of his annual salary ov ap uximately 5 months

SUBJECT 2, MY. Grayston Lynch

1.) Assuming no interruptions or changes of as#igne
ment or status in the interim , ir, Lynch will complete
his currently seheduled Spanish language tratning in
mid-April 1971, Between now and then it is understood
that he will--on his: own initiative and with whatever
assistance and encouragement we can properly provide--=
make an effort to overcome his Phobia of flying and
thereby, in due course, qualify medically fur TOY or PCS
overseas fivld duty.

2. In view of Mr, Lynch's past history, however,

we cannot assume that he will be suce ul or will even
3 to overcome his problem. In spite of his
agent status and his operational performance

we cannot, in all conscience, carry

: 3.. Tt is prudent, therefore, to begin contin-
gency planuing' now for his Appropriate retirement and
outplacement into a job which will offer hin both security
and personal satisfaction, His Spanish language training
should enlarge his horizons and eopportunitics, We can
predict he will not, at least at first, take at all kindly
to the idea of retirement and relinquishing his Agenay
association, He is emotionally involved, and identifies
himself as an Agency career field operations officer,

™ "BL Ik de strongly recommended that Mr, Graysten L, Lynch —
be approves ac a participant in the CLA Retlroniont énd Disabillty

System.

2. I io the opinion of tho Speclat Operations Division that
the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the tine he enterad on daty
in February 196!) until early 1968 meet the spirit and intent of the
criteria for “qualltying service! as defines in tif 20-50b. The lono
exception to thase criterta is that Mr. Lynch ‘as not "abroad"
during the time Involved except ona sporacile bacia, Thlo exception,

“however, wae due complotely to the geographical location of the area
of operstions. This lecation made it uniquely propitious to have

My, -Lynch assigned to and work out oi a domestic base. There lo
no question, howover, that Mr. Lyach's service waa fn the conduct
and support of covert operations which required continulny practice
ef security and tratecrait procedures ani which Included, from.

‘time to time, hasarie to hie life and healii, it le alee balluves

that Me. Lyach would be at a dlsadvantayo In obtaining other employ-
ment because of the senvitivity of hia past service.aa well as tho
dearth: of requirements for his pecullar background, okills and

knowledge.

3. Go the basia of the above ani! Mr. Lynch's uniquo per-
penal record, it ts believed that his service curing the described
period le certainly equivalent to if not in oxcess of the requirements
for "creaitable service abroad” ani that if it hod not beon fora
geographical accident, this service would have bean porlormed as

Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination or

training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be
’ some whose perforvance will be better than would be: expected froa their test
scores, Just as there will Likely be sose whose rerformance is poorer than
expected. STRENGTH ‘OF MOTIVATION, FRIGR EXPERIENCE WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE,
and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language train~
ing and in interpréting language training results. For ¢xarple, the number of
languages previously studfed.or learned and the amount of acadesic and non-
acatemic language -learning experience are factors not measured ty the tests dut
Gre indicative of probable “success in learning a foretgn languuge. Whether
such experience was in the saze language as the one to be studled or ina
different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/WH/B&F

SUBJECT - : Federal Income Taxes
Irving G. DEVUONO (P), Contract Frnployee

1, During hie recent visit to Headquarters, DEVUONO raised quentions i
concerning hia Feleral income tax returns and Interest allegedly duo for
income received during calendar year 1962. He stated he had file covert
returns for 196] and 1963 and that he would file a covert return for 1964. He
had previously been advised that he owed interest on hin 1962 income inthe
amount of $165.54. He stated that this wae not correct as the verbal (nstruc-
tions given him b+; Mr. Robert Blade rgroen of OGC were followed by him when

he filed hia 1962 covert return. According to DEVUONO, Biadergroen discuesed

tax mattera with him during a visit to JMWAVE sometime in April 1963.

2. As i was not previously acquainted with the facts in DEVUONO's case, '
1 did not attempt to Judge it nor to promise him that it:coul-t be resolved to 4
his satisfaction, [ did, however, inform him we would investigate the matter
and would officially advise the Station of the decioion, Therefore, please
initiate appropriate action with the covert tax people and the Office of General
Counpol (Mr. :Bladergrocn) to set this matter at rest, Informally, Bladergroen™
informs me that he recalls hia conversations with DEVUONO and that DE VUONO
either did not understand his Inatructions or chose to dlaregard ther. I believe.
Mra. O'Leary and at least one othor member of her staff with whon: DEVUONO
consulted during his vieit can ansist in resolving this matter. 1-10 not find any
correspondence in his Personnel Folder other than a copy of a cable, IN 57726,
dated 12 June 1963, bearing on thia Subject. . .

‘FROM ts Chief, Finance, JMWAVE
SUBJECT : Tax Problem of Irving G, DEVUONO |

A While on TDY at Headquarters, the writer conferred

with the Head of the Covert Tax Unit on the subject problem,
The writer was informed that the Covert Tax Unit. is not able
to accept and forward a Covert return for the year 1962 for
the subject individual since a Form 1099 had been issued,

al Revenue Service, while
performing a service last yoar (tax year 1961) of this nature,
would not under any circumstances permit a person and/or
persons receiving.a Form 1099 or W-2 to file a Covert Return
for such reported income. Therefore, it appears all avenues
of escape for Irving. G. DEVUONO have been closed and he should

file an amended return for Tax Year 1962 to include the KUBARK
income reported on Form 1099,

necessary for training become. available,

an 4. The standards for members of the group should be con-
stantly -upyraded by culling of members who become marginal or who
do not develop ag expécted. Recruitment vf promising new members
will be dependent on the needs of the station based on policy
directives. Priority should be Riven to sabotage training to
permit the mounting of a sabotage. program at the earliest possible
moment. Coincidentally, Planning’ and thought should be given to
training and establishment of

a full scale operational program should be developed, . Also, the
force should be identified to the primary exile authority as a

- non political and tndependent body which is unilaterally engaged

in the overthrow of the existing regime, The tempo. of training
should be maintained at a level sufficient to assure the continual
proficiency of the group in all categories of activity in readiness

pees

: “oi

1. The subject report being cue, the writer is the
only person observing DEVUONO's werk and has statements
and commendations which should be reflected in his fitness
report. The contents of this memorandum will be established
in DEVUONO's file in other form at later date by the writer.

2.  DEVUONO has completed one year with CUSOG. ‘In this
period he has shown a complete ane era actical knowledge of
paramilitary techniques and tactics This knowledge is born
of experience and application, “application of this
knowledge for KUBARK has tecuited np visible progress in the
technical abilities of CUSOG persoanel.

- 3. He has shared CUSOG respensibilities of organization,
administration’ and operational preparation in a manner to

‘follow out KUBARK practices to its credit.

4, He carries cut clear instructions to the letter,
reflecting a military background.

S. Contrary to observances nected in a previous fitness
report DEVUONO has been found to be anything but naive in
his dealings with PSRUMENS during the period observed.

6. His administrative and acccunting procedures within
.CUSOG are in order,

7. Hesitating to call them weaxnesses, the writer must
state that DIEVUONO's entire experience with KUBARK has been
field experience, usually far out en a long string of contacts
into a KUBARK Anstallaticn, a fact which has prevented a look
at any of the administrative side ef paramilitary as conducted

by KUBARK,

8. This man has good potential for helping KUBARK's
paramilitary effort, which potential will. be nore effective
when‘he has been schooled in the terminologies and peculari-
ties of paramilitary KUBARK-style. It is recunsended a tour

-by' DEVUONO where such schooling can be conducted as on-the-

job training would. most bring out this potential.

gincore in his efforts to fight Communism. Hie performanco sinco Aug. 1961
bas pot been at ths top-level of his capabilities for sevoral roasons,

not all of vhich aro within hia ability.to overcome. Subject has had

little clandestine training, and is therefore not always ablo to compro-

hend tha intaazible factors which provent, dolay and cangul operations.

A furthor reason 19 tho absence of military daw as. ao basis for discipline

forhis men. Still another reason is tho directive for only limited |
[action wita.which ho has had to’ Tive since August. Thies is meroly to say
‘Tthat in a period of policy: formation whon the action forces have had to

‘be holdin liabo, be nas not boen at his best. : . :

-, Bubject’sa dealings with bis agents have in turn been affected by his
own frustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted
in. obtuse explanétions to thom which havo made thom harder to handle.

His reluctance to put..things’ on. paper has detracted from his porformanco
and denied bim the clarifying procosa which reporting provides, iis
security conpcicusness has beon similarly affected by his frustrations.

' Subject 18 in need of training in tradecraft and PM operations. His
basic qualifications for Pi Case Officer work gro wuch that ho can,with
training, do a such better job.’ This combined with a program of concen=
tratod action would undoubtedly bring out the best in bin, which should

sequently for their training and developmental aseizaatnts untsl they

.& security cleararces
b. Medical Clearances
/€. provision of cover
d. Financial Sriefing
e. Assessment and Evaluation

5. Training and development requires that subject bo be pro-
vided tutorial or group training, according to thetr individual needs,
to qualify them as senior PM Officers capable of serving overseas as
case officer, instfuators, advisers, or consultants; and capable of
developamg Sidigenous forces, directing operations, and personally
participating in operations. ‘The training envisioned normally vould
inelude, but not be limited to:

' periods of time ao the employees are under the furiadtiction of the Di-
viston for operational cuties. For administrative Furposes, it is sug-
seated that Wil Division assume these responsibilities for both Robertson
and lynch az of 2 June 101,

of these ‘two officera has been that their lack of association with the
Auency, thus far, permite their opsrational uttlization in circumstances
where staff employees cannot participate, ant tuetr long range con-
tinued employment {8, to a certain extent, depeantent on their being
abot to maintain this rosture. It te requested, therefore, that you
take every reasonable srecaution to maintain thelr “denlable"” status.
