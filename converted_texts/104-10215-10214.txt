11 April 1958
MEMORANDUH FOR: | Ciief, FI/Staff .
SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA — Request for Fromotion ..
a

1. -It is requested that Arthur G, Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted j
from GS-11 to grade GS-12 for his outstanding performance in carrying out a so
precarious mission in line with the objectives of Project AMPHODARCH, in .
which he is the Principal Agent. :

2. In early January 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to
contact Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Meestra mountains
in south-eastern Cuba. He arranged for his fres passage into the Sierras
through contacts within the 26 July Movement which the and the Station.
developed earlier. After the necessary arrangements, Vaivada left La Habana
on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras.
under the escort of rebel guides. Inthe course of approximately twenty
days! stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, during which
time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied
Castro and a force of about, 200 rebels on their dam attack on the town of
Manzanillo on 26 March 1958 At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with . : .
the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana. Ji i

3. During his relatively short stay in the Sierra Naestra mountains, : i
Vaivada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational i 1
information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic ‘ !
coverage of his trip. - i

4. This exploit is another achievexent to be added’ to the impressive |
past performances of Arthur G, Vaivada, who has always shown a deep devotion.
to his work and to the agency. .

5 Vadivada was born on 20 June 1922, and has been with CIA since 1919. .
He has been a career agent since 1 June 1957, ana was promoted to the grade .
‘of GS-11 on 1 June 1957... His tour of duty in Cuba was from August 1954 until
32 March 1958.

because he had not had a clear picture of what the proposed assignment :
in Mexico involved. He was pleased to find out that it was a pure
penetration assignment. He also responded enthusiastically to the idea |
of receiving Headquarters briefings prior to going to the Field. He -
Stated that he would like to have a short leave in Costa Rica prior to
receiving the Headquarters briefing, : :

4 fhe Verve dae :
SUBJECT: Subject of our letter nuwer 4U25; interest in Assignment
inv. 5, :

Abie Saqith
: 1. In recent conversations with both JRp and RDS, Subject has
! broachea the prospect of a possible assignment within the U.S, follow.
-| ing completion of pis Habana assignrent. He Says he would not wat his
Hy Statements re reassignment which wore recently forwarded to Headquartars
i . to be interpreted to nean tnat he is not interested in a U.S. tour, He
. Says that he has been giving mich thought to his future career, as well
as to the needs of his family, ie points out that he personally has now.
. Spent approximately 16 years, excepting vacations and short training :
periods, living ma working outside tne U. S,, that nis two cnilaren
have never lived tnere, and tnat poth he and his wire are concerned
: that too’ mech time will elajse befcre they can provide their children
i with a period in the U. 5, during taeir formative years,

| 2. It ia the opinion of both HDS and JKP that Subject is at a

i point in his career development wnere a tour at Headquarters would Loe
| be extremely beneficial, The station lacks knowledge conceming the : :

; Specific deaaquartars jobs to which a person of Subject ’s status might H

i be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR soretimes emplcys 4

: these persons as instructors, ie believe that a tour with OTh would i

i not only remedy in great measure deficiencies in Subdject’s background © F H
caused by lack of Heaiquarters experience, but would at the sane time |
i afford OiR excellent instructor material, '

3. In view of Subject’s own interest in such an assignment, and
our estimate of tos potential value to nim and to the Organization
that would accrue from it, we recormend tnat Headquarters arrange such
am assignment if at all possible.

hb. In view of the likelihood of Subject’s transfer in the near’
future, a prompt decision is requested, : . :

FROM : Acting Chief of Static

SUBJECT: GeneRa—Cerational

seccric—Arthur G. VAL

Reference: HkH-N-2380, dated 16 Octoter 1957-

1. The Subject has no objection to suboitting to an LOFLUTTER test
at the convenience of Headevarters, This could be eesily errenged here
jn the event an LCFLUTTER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana;
on the cther hand, VAIVADA could just es easily go to any designated slece
in Florida in order to take this test. It is undersi-od that LOFLUTTER
teams from time to time visit that state.

2. ‘The Station will take such measures as are feesible to cover the
activities of Subject and his wife while in Aabane.

3. While the watter was not roferred to in the reference, Susject’s
projected one-year tour of duty will end in June, 1958, at which time it

SUBJECT t Request for Conversion cf Arthur G. WATVADS From
Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE t HKH-A-2577

1. Referenced dispatch fron the field recommends the conversion
of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents
& strong case for such conversion, VAIVADA has served Cla in a con-
tract capacity since 1949, with a continuous high level of perfor-
mance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. ie is cure
rently assigned to Cuba and is expected to remain there indefinitely.
VAIVADA is 34 years-old and was promoted recently to the equivalent’
of a GS-10 rating. His expressed career interests lie in contimed

‘employment by CIA, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover

assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) is a Costa Rican
citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion som-

what. She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, hovever,

and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next
several months, barring unforeseen developments. She will be required

“to spend most of this period in the U.S. and is currently making
. plans. to do so. me : ‘ :

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire fora |
eareer with CIA, it is recomended that he be granted staff status
at grade GS-11, contingent upon his wife's first becoming a U.S.
citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements.
There is available in WH Division a staff. position (BAF-L09) to
which VAIVADA can be ‘assigned. .

4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for

covert training in the near future.

S. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to
staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested,

: SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA; Staff status

1. The undersigned discussed case this date with Mr. Byers:
(2709 "I"; telephone extension 2551-2552) and with Mr.,Pennington \. | lay ;
(20k "1") both of Security Division. Mr.-Hyers. was shown the con-\ !* A 9

i and apprised of the problea of Mrs. VAIVADA not being a U.S. citis Trak Tha

| zen. Myers stated that, while cases like this were usually very “a ;
: difficult, he felt this particular one might be justified in view | wen il os

i of VAIVADA's long. and excellent record with the Agency and the réla-| ; vlan may 1
! tively long tine during which ha has bees married. Myers indicated ” ae j
i that the procedure would be as follows: ; cenit ;
H ,

Presentation of a formal request for waiver on citizenship Trl “he ,

requirements for spouse and granting of staff status to Subject. 7 weud be ;
The memorandum would be prepared for Personnel, would then go L Mi i ‘
to Security, and subsequently, with recommendations of. both, Wad ont i
me to Deputy Director, who would have the final decision in this | (retiteble |
° case. : . tg Cerca i

Myers was to discuss the matter further with other elements of ="
Security and advise within the next several days as to what the next
step should be. :

ew

2. Considering the possibility that such a request might be
turned down, the undersigned discussed with Pennington the proce. Lo 2
dures for acquisition of citizenship for Mra. VAIVADA, and deter--
mined that this should be relatively simple. The requirements were: :
Presence in the 0.3. (vicinity of.Washington) for approximately . =
forty-five days with some additional time to. acquire’ passport: So - Maes
long as we have Rothing that would make. her inadmissable to the.U.S.. -

"the basic requirements would bér ability:to speak. Englisn and to ~~
pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be giver -
to her for study. Security would presumbly handle her case when -
she arrives in -the States. woe - -

3. It has occurred to. the uadersigned that perhaps, if it is
necessary for Mraz. VAIVADA to acquire citizenship, VAIVADA hinself .
could be brought: to the Washington vicinity for trainiag’ purposes |
“im order’ to facilitate the visit of his wife, expenses, etc. This
would at the same tine afford an opportunity to provide FALVADA

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 1 Proposed Staff Status for Arthur. G. VATVADA
REFERENCE : HEH-A-2577, 17 April 1956

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion
of contract agent Arthur C. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a
good case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract:
capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of performance; firet
in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba.. He is°34 yéara old and”
was pyomoted recently to the equivalent.of a grade GS-10. His ex-
pressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, ‘mere —
specially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which a
he is highly suited.

Ye

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse. “(since 1945) 48 a Costa:
Rican citizen. Prelininary ‘investigation at Headquarters has revealed
te that Subject's conversion to staff status ‘is virtually out of the —
Som 7 question so long as hia wife remains an alien. It has also been de~ °
- . termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenship within. .
a span of h5 days if she so desires and is willing to. come to the .
US. for that period of time.” This would remove the major stumbling
block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA. . “t

3. In view of VATVADA'a outstanding record as a contract agont,
his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca- |
reer with CIA, it 1s recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encoursged ©
to seek U.S. citizenship | under the terms outlined above (b) VAIVADA.,
be granted staff status, ‘contingent upon his wife's. first becoming .
a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other: requirements. a
C/WH/III has endorsed the récommendation for staff status and a sug-
gestion by C/WH/Admin that BAF-L09, a new position cirrently alloted
to San Jose, be- transferred to Habana to ‘be filled by VaIvaDA.. -

| be Tt ts further reccomended that UH Division consider bring. |.
ing. VWAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincidée-with his wife's
stay (at Headquarters! convenience). . This would. facilitate acquisi- ©
tion of citizenship for the wife and at the same time afford VAIVADA

&@ chance for additional Headquarters training. . _ Subject previously
received covert training at Headquarters from s October” ‘through 25

Memo on Cover Status = Arthur G, Vaivada

1. Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in xeering with the
nature of this notional cover plan‘of, a temporar. nature, Careful
consideration has been given to a mumber of ideas, all of which were
rejected because possible local conflicts.. This idea is still general
H enough (and I hope convincing) to lesve opportunity for changes and/or
: improvement at Headquarters, The idea, and the terminology, was
i gleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1956 study
! published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,

: . . 2 As I understand this cover arrangement, the P3I sheuld mail me

; a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed information, This

i should "hold us" for a couple of months, with possibly some queries from
me occasionally, Then when our operational picture requires investigation
in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to
request a survey or poll in that field. -

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and

;

i

H allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration
i of this "Agency" and ther advise PSI as to the legal requirement.

MELORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

7 SUBJECT: Vaivada

1. During the morning of 30 April Mr. Millard of Cover tele-
phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508. Mr. Millard said that
; he would be meeting.with Vaivada at 1600 hours today and proposed
io providing him with a temorary rather than permanent cover with
: the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range
development. Mr. Millard's reasoning ras that he did not wish
to place Vaivada under the new company with the chance that the
trial period approved for. the Station might cause Vaivada to be
: : pulled out from that cover in short order. lfr, Millard said that
i the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.

2. I concurred with the above proposal.

1, Reference 1 mde to OS's vertal request of 7 March 1957, for
additional infermtion on Subject dn connection with our request for a
Provisional Covert Security Approval dated 26 February 1957,

2. Subject was born in Do Falb, Dunois, on 20 June 1922, Hoe
received his primary and hich echaot oduestion tn De Kalb and ontered
tho U. S. Aray in 1940, later transferring to the U. S. Air Force. Ho
Served as an operations and intelligence specialist, firat in the China~
Burma theater and Ister in Tanam. He wae discharged from the service
in 1945 with the grade of Techrical Sergeant. After his diacharge, he
worked for a brief period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling .
(Tlinois) Silica—Cel Corporation and then returred to the Fonam Canal
: “Zone to marry a Costa Rican girl in December 1945. For about four uonths
. : H . he vorked as a stevedora and labor foremn in the Carel Zone, In April

1946 he re-enlisted in the Air Foree in the Canal Zone and vas discharged
three yosrs later, in 1949. . a °

3e Tate in 1943 he was reeruited by the Agency, and on 1 Jung 19/49
decams o CIA contract agent. ‘Since that date, he has served as a con]
tract agent with coatimaing hizh level parformeco, first in Costa Rica,
Jater in Gutemla and Cum. Ife is currently assigned to Cuba whare he
is utilized as Principal Agent of Project A: FIODARCI. Subject bas worked
principally and successfully so, on Comzunist Party penetration opera~
tiona since his engsgenent with CIA, and his current vork involves tha
handling of a net of agents providing coverage of Communist, leftist,
revolutionary and other political activitics at the University of Habana,
and the student-youth cireles in generul in Cuba.

be Subject has always proven to be loyal and trustworthy. In view
of hia outstanding record aod strong overall qualifications, and his
expressed desire for a career with CIA, it has teen recommended he be
converted froa contrect to career agent status, Ilo was promoted recently
to the oquivalent of a GS-10 rating.

‘SUBJECT : Request for Conversion of Arthur G. VAIVADA from
’ Contract to Career Agent Status

REFERENCE 3 HKH-A-2577 conn

‘of contract agent. Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status and- presents a |
strong case for such conversion. ‘Upon receiving a formal KED request to. :
for such action, however, your Plans Staff sugzested that career :
agent status would be more appropriate in this case, and further
indicated that staff status for VAIVADA is virtually out of the _
question at this time. .The request is being re-sutmitted, therefore,
in revised form to provide for conversion to career rether than staff
status. A ‘ ee .
2. VAIVADA hes served CIA in a contract capacity since 1949, with
@ continuous high level of parformnce; first im Cesta Rica, later in
Guatem.la and Cua. He ja currently assigned to Cule and i's expected to i
remain there indefinitely. VAIVADA is 34 years old and ves prosoted 7 :

. intereats lie in continued employment by CIA, more especially in the j
_ area of unofficial cover assignnents, for which he is highly suited. }

f
: }
3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent, b. i
his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a H :
career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted career eégent |
Status. A PHS and a new contract check list (in duplicate) are attached.
4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVATA to the U.S. for ;
covert training during the latter part of 1957,

5. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to
